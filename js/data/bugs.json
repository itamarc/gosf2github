The bin subdirectory contains a fixed teitodocx. If you run make as follows, the build will complete because make will use the fixed tool:\r\n\r\n$ PATH=./bin:$PATH make\r\n\r\n2\\. It appears that teitodocx passes to ant a parameter named profiledir. However the file /usr/share/xml/tei/stylesheet/docx/build-to.xml expects profileDir \\(note how \\\"Dir\\\" is capitalized\\).\r\n\r\n3\\. Grepping through /usr/bin/teito\\* for -Dprofiledir and -DprofileDir shows that all the various teitoX tools expect the parameter to be called profiledir, not profileDir.\r\n\r\n4\\. Grepping through /usr/share/xml/tei/stylesheet/\\*/\\* shows that /usr/share/xml/tei/stylesheet/docx/build-to.xml expects profileDir but usr/share/xml/tei/stylesheet/html/build-to.xml expects profiledir. And the parameter does not seem to be defined anywhere else.\r\n\r\nHence, the file /usr/share/xml/tei/stylesheet/docx/build-to.xml is the only place where profileDir is expected. It should be changed to expect profiledir, for consistency with other files and tools.",

In the TEI scheme of things, phrase-level elements such as &lt;q> or &lt;said> cannot both contain chunk-level elements such as &lt;p> or &lt;l>and be contained by them: you need to represent this kind of structure using either standoff or milestones. I am not certain from your example, but if what you want is to show that the first two lines of a stanza (or parts of other lines) are to be read as direct speech, an easy way would be to use a milestone element to mark where the direct speech begins and ends. &lt;said> is for direct speech, by the way, not quotation from another source, which is &lt;quote; ",

What I find confusing in the example above is that the lines become valid if one removes the `<lg>` element, but I suppose that it's taking `<q>` and its allies as equivalent to `<lg>`? The idea of using `<milestone/>` is interesting, though using it as an alternative to `<quote>` or `<seg>` is complicated by its lack of @source.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the 'bug', then, is simply that the guidelines do not say anything specific about dealing with anything that requires quotation marks within `<l>`: encoding a simple dialogue that runs across several lines can be quite time-consuming, and from the several alternatives available it's not altogether clear which method is most likely to be interpreted correctly by other software.",

  "description": "Ron Van den Branden reports:\r\n\r\n>When trying to create a new TEI P5 document in Oxygen (version 15.0, build 2013071613), I noticed TEI P5 isn't listed in the available document types. I have followed the instructions at http://tei-l.970651.n3.nabble.com/automated-upgrade-to-TEI-framework-in-oXygen-td4023241.html (note: apart from a note in the TEI XSLT stylesheets documentation this is the only pointer I could find to installation notes for the TEI Oxygen framework), and currently have version 1.2.7 of the TEI framework loaded in Oxygen.\r\n\r\n>Also, Oxygen can't validate documents that just contain a TEI P5 namespace (which happens automatically by grace of the TEI P5 document association which is present in Oxygen). Instead, a validation error is thrown, stating that the schema is not found at\r\n%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Roaming\\com.oxygenxml\\extensions\\v15.0\\frameworks\\http___www.tei_c.org_release_oxygen_updateSite.oxygen\\tei\\xml\\tei\\custom\\schema\\relaxng\\tei_all.rng.\r\n\r\n>On closer inspection, the fault seems to lie with the zip file referenced in <http://www.tei-c.org/release/oxygen/updateSite.oxygen>. Whereas older versions of the TEI Framework had tei\\xml\\tei\\custom\\schema and tei\\xml\\tei\\custom\\odd folders, the current version at https://oxygen-tei.googlecode.com/files/tei-2.5.0-7.1.0.zip only contains an empty tei\\xml\\tei\\custom\\templates folder.\r\n\r\n>So, unless those folders have been removed intentionally, the latest zip file of the TEI framework at https://oxygen-tei.googlecode.com/files/tei-2.5.0-7.1.0.zip seems to be incomplete? \r\n\r\nConfirmed on a fresh install of Oxygen 15.0 and a fresh install of the add-on.

I still think it is a problem that should be solved even if my suggested solution doesn't work.  \r\n\r\nBut I don't have another one to hand.  How is the ODD transformed to HTML.  \\(XSL 1.0 stylesheet I'm assuming.\\)  \r\n\r\nI'm assuming that using an entity reference wouldn't work here?  Other possible suggestions would involve trying to pass the CSS as a string parameter \\(too large maybe?\\), or writing an extension function for the processor \\(icky\\).\r\n\r\nThere is another possibility of course.  Since the website \\(currently at least\\) is running cocoon, we could have a URI that the XSLT includes which results in an XML version of the CSS.  http://www.tei-c.org/tei.css.xml or something.  You  have cocoon match this url and wrap the existing css in a single root element.\r\n\r\nSo the file is:\r\n\r\nbody \\{font-size:300%;\\}\r\n...\r\n\r\nand the XML version is:\r\n\r\n&lt;style type=\"text/css\"&gt;\r\nbody \\{font-size:300%\\}\r\n...\r\n&lt;/style&gt;\r\n\r\nI think the way to do that in cocoon is aggregation, I think.\r\n\r\n",

The  definition of `<constraint>` that appears both in p5odds.odd and in p5odds-examples.odd (used for Guidelines validation) is completely different from that in constraint.xml (for regular TEI schemas). In constraint.xml we see: \r\n\r\n~~~~~~~\r\n<content>\r\n    <rng:choice>\r\n      <rng:text/>\r\n      <rng:ref name=\"macro.anyXML\"/>\r\n    </rng:choice>\r\n  </content>\r\n~~~~~~~\r\nwhile in p5odds.odd and p5odds-examples.odd, we see:\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~\r\n<content>\r\n  <zeroOrMore xmlns=\"http://relaxng.org/ns/structure/1.0\">\r\n    <choice>\r\n      <text/>\r\n      <ref name=\"anySchematron\"/>\r\n      <ref name=\"anyISOSchematron\"/>\r\n    </choice>\r\n  </zeroOrMore>\r\n</content>\r\n~~~~~~~\r\n\r\nI suspect the intention was the reverse of the result: the Guidelines content model is supposed to be more restrictive (only text or Schematron), whereas the general definition is intended to be open to XML languages other than Schematron; the problem is that the constraint as it is written allows only one instance of macro.anyXML, which itself appears to allow for only a single element. In other words, in the Guidelines we are allowed to use (and suggest as examples) complex constraints which are not actually allowed if you're working with the regular TEI schema; and we do use them (e.g. in f.xml), which means they're perfectly reasonable and should be available to everyone.\r\n\r\nI therefore believe this is a corrigible error, and that Ron's suggestion of this content model:\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~\r\n<rng:zeroOrMore>\r\n  <rng:choice>\r\n    <rng:text/>\r\n    <rng:ref name=\"macro.anyXML\"/>\r\n  </rng:choice>\r\n</rng:zeroOrMore>\r\n~~~~~~~\r\n\r\nshould be implemented as a matter of urgency, because there is at least one example in the Guidelines that can't actually be followed at the moment.",

I still think we should have changed type= of &lt;name&gt; to of= or\r\nofA= \\(or category= or objectType= entityType= or whatever\\) before P5\r\nwas published.\r\n\r\nGiven, however, that P5 has been published, I am not sure the\r\n\"advantages of doing so outweigh the disadvantages\" \\[TCW09\\]. On the\r\nother hand, it would be easy to update documents via XSLT to use the\r\nnew attribute. So perhaps if TEI provided that stylesheet ...\r\n\r\nHowever, either way, there is no reason that &lt;name&gt; should not have\r\nsubtype= given that &lt;persName&gt; does.\r\n\r\nLou's concern that it is better to leave type= locally defined so that\r\nwe can better document how it is used is reasonable \\(given that we\r\ncurrently have no mechanism for adding documented values to a\r\nclass-defined attribute, which we definitely need\\). So I suggest that\r\nif Council does not change type= to something more sensible, then\r\nsubtype= should be added to &lt;name&gt;. \\(Until we can properly apply a\r\nprofile to an attribute inherited from a class.\\)\r\n\r\n\r\nanon.&gt; 2. The attribute 'extent' in &lt;gap&gt; should probably be\r\nanon.&gt;    'quantity' to be consistent with for instance &lt;space&gt;. The\r\nanon.&gt;    correct thing is probably to add the class att.dimensions to\r\nanon.&gt;    &lt;gap&gt;, and remove its local attributes 'unit' and 'extent'.\r\n\r\nI \\(sort of\\) agree. &lt;gap&gt; should have either extent= alone carrying\r\nboth quantity and unit, or it should have separate quantity= and unit=\r\nattributes. To be consistent with other elements quantity= and unit=\r\nwould be the way to go, although in my mind a single extent= is more\r\nlogical on &lt;gap&gt;. Either way, as LB points out, it is a change that\r\nbreaks backwards compatibility, and it's not entirely clear that it is\r\nworth it. Since the change is small and easy to update to via XSLT,\r\nI'm inclined to say it is, but I'm not convinced.\r\n",

Making an assumption about what you might have in mind, I will say that a title, however \"canonical\", is not guaranteed to have a single unambiguous referent - this is what library \"control numbers\" are for, and these are precisely the kinds of things that should be used as @key or @ref values, IMHO.\r\n\r\nRegarding point \\(2\\) \\(there not being a standard TEI element to represent a \"canonical literary work\"\\), I think that if the referent of a title/@key were a TEI element, then a \"canonical\" title in a bibl somewhere might be appropriate, but to my mind the primary use case is rather to link title elements to external records in library systems.\r\n\r\n",

Besides Conal's example of disambiguating two works with\r\nthe same canonical title, I may have a local prosopographic or\r\nbibliographic authority file to which I want my instances to point,\r\nbut I want that local authority file to point to an external resource.\r\n\r\n\r\nLB&gt; \\(2\\) @key and @ref usually point to a &lt;person&gt;, &lt;place&gt;, or &lt;org&gt;\r\nLB&gt;     or other \"named entity\". If we are going to treat canonical\r\nLB&gt;     titles in the same way, won\\#'t we need to have a special place\r\nLB&gt;     for them, a &lt;listTitle&gt; as it were? or is the idea that you'd\r\nLB&gt;     point to a &lt;bibl&gt; containing the canonical title? \r\n\r\nYes, I think we most certainly will need to have a special place for\r\nthem, and we've already got it: &lt;listBibl&gt;.\r\n\r\nFWIW, the WWP is currently planning to use ref= on &lt;title&gt;, whether or\r\nnot TEI does.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs for &lt;lang&gt;, I think the arguments are similar in favor, but there\r\nis a twist: TEI has already decided on a canonical method for\r\nindicating a natural language, and enforced it for use on xml:lang=. I\r\nsee no reason not to use the same mechanism \\(BCP 47 language tag,\r\nwhich if it includes private use information must have, and otherwise\r\nmay have, an associated &lt;language&gt; identified by a matching tag on its\r\nident=\\) for &lt;lang&gt;. E.g.:\r\n&lt;lang tag=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\"&gt;English&lt;/lang&gt;\r\n&lt;lang tag=\"en\" xml:lang=\"es\"&gt;ingl\u00e9s&lt;/lang&gt;\r\n&lt;lang tag=\"es\" xml:lang=\"en\"&gt;Spanish&lt;/lang&gt;\r\n&lt;lang tag=\"es\" xml:lang=\"es\"&gt;espa\u00f1ol&lt;/lang&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\nI think the idea of something similar for &lt;resp&gt; is interesting, but\r\nout of scope for this particular feature request.\r\n",

The dates are 4 years. So attending Cherwell for 4 years is quite reasonable. If the intent was \u201cattended for 1 year sometime between\u201d then I think the content would reflect that.\r\n\r\n2.

(Or fix it.)\r\n\r\nMy point is that ordinary people (i.e., those who have not internalized the difference between notBefore= & notAfter= and from= & to=) reading this example will interpret it to mean \u201cat Cherwell for 4 years\u201d, not that the person was at Cherwell for one or more minutes sometime in this 4-year span.\r\n\r\nAs for evidence for the frequency of cases, I\u2019m not sure what evidence would convince you. I don\u2019t have anything other than toy personographies that use \uff1ceducation\uff1e, not even in all the TAPAS test data. That said, taking a quick scan through some existing personographies I find that for the vast majority of cases we either\r\na) know, or can find out, exactly when this person went to which school, or\r\nb) have no idea, and don\u2019t even have a way to find out, when this person went to school (other than \u201cwhen she was alive, probably in her youth\u201d).\r\nFor cases of (a) we would use from= and to=; for cases of (b) we would most likely not use \uff1ceducation\uff1e at all.\r\nI imagine that there are cases where we would have evidence that a person was at a particular school sometime between X and Y. But if that were the case, we would have more than just \u201cattended Z\u201d as the content. (E.g., \u201cwas at Z during W\u2019s senior year, 1896\u201d or whatever.)",

I would absolutely have to say @notAfter=\"1976-07-31\". Similarly, I know I started some time in September 1970, but who could know which day? @notBefore=\"1970-09-01\". I maintain that this is the norm, not the exception. And I absolutely would use `<education>` for this.\r\n\r\nWorking with early modern texts as I do a lot these days, I find myself using @notBefore and @notAfter all the time; dates are typically imprecise, and the best you can do is establish the best-knowable boundaries in this way.",

I guess that what this really means is that the @start element is expecting the @ident values of elements defined in the schema, not their QNames. You can figure this out from the SVG example, but I think it would be clearer if the definition of @start specified explicitly that what's required is the bare @ident with no namespace qualification.\r\n\r\nI have no idea what happens if you want to have a custom element in your own namespace, but which has the same local name as an existing TEI element. That's probably a bad idea for all sorts of reasons, but it shouldn't be structurally impossible; namespaces are supposed to allow for this sort of thing.",

For example, we don't support the ability to specify whether multiple start patterns are combined or interleaved.

Minimally, the general content model of &lt;egXML&gt; should be replaced with the adapted definition from tei\\_odds.odd.\r\n2\\. Optimally, the general content model of &lt;egXML&gt; should be relaxed to allow for any XML element\r\n3\\.

A content model of ANY or of plain text would not give us this \\(very useful\\) degree of validation. This is why we use the definition in tei\\_odds rather than the \"canonical\" one. The latter is different because we don't assume that everyone will necessarily want to use  egXML in TEI ODD documents. We chose \"text\" as the least annoying possible content model for people wanting to use this element to mark up examples from other XML syntaxes, fully expecting that they might want to modify it in the same way that we have for ODD purposes. I agree that ANY would have been another choice we might have made, so that egXML examples would at least be constrained to be well-formed.\r\n\r\nI don't understand the point you are making about the namespace.\r\n\r\n",

However, I\r\nonly agree with one of your three suggestions, as follows.\r\n\r\n1\\. The content model from tei\\_odds.odd is, deliberately, \\*far\\* more\r\nrestrictive than the generic &lt;egXML&gt; element's content, because it\r\nis not intended to be used for any TEI document \\(which might, e.g.,\r\nbe used to exemplify some non-TEI language or elements outside the\r\nTEI namespace\\). The tei\\_odd schema is not intended for use by the\r\ngeneral user, but rather the user who wants to write an ODD for a\r\nTEI customization.\r\n\r\n2\\. The general content model for &lt;egXML&gt; always should have been\r\nsomething that constrains the content to match the prose, e.g.\r\nusing the pattern 'any', declared as\r\nany = \\( element \\* \\{ any\\* \\} | attribute \\* \\{ text \\}\\* | text \\)\r\nmight do the trick. I think this is an egregious and corrigible\r\nerror, although it is a minor one.\r\n\r\n3\\. AFAIK, there is no difference between\r\n&lt;egXML xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples\"&gt;\r\nand\r\n&lt;eg:egXML xmlns:eg=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples\"&gt;\r\nAs far as an XML processor is concerned, those two are the same.\r\n\\(The element with local-name 'egXML' from the namespace\r\n'http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples'.\\) While I can see the argument\r\nthat the latter might be a little easier for humans to follow\r\nwhat's going on \\(less likely your eye skips the detail that the\r\nelement is in a different namespace\\), it may turn out to be quite a\r\npain to maintain in the source for the Guidelines, depending on the\r\nsoftware used \\(as everytime one ran the source through a processor,\r\nit may change it back\\).\r\n",

  "description": "On 2007-10-27 srahtz normalized the use of alien namespaces in the TEI Guidelines \\(r3833\\). Back then, a child of &lt;egXML&gt; that was in an alien namespace showed up with its prefix, without any visible binding of that prefix. This meant that the first example of section 20.4 showed up as having &lt;xi:include&gt; elements, and the reader was not aware that \u201cxi\u201d was \\(inappropriately, but necessarily\\) bound to the namespace \u201chttp://www.example.org/ns/nonTEI\u201d.\\[1\\] That is, the reader of the processed Guidelines saw a \\(mildly\\) incomplete, but correct example.\r\n\r\nBut now this example shows up without prefixes, and with each &lt;include&gt; element having an explicit xmlns= attribute that shows the example namespace, leaving readers with a complete, but erroneous example.\r\n\r\nNote\r\n\\----\r\n\\[1\\] This is inappropriate, because the point of the example is to demonstrate the use of the &lt;include&gt; element in the \u201chttp://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude\u201d namespace. It is necessary because we \\*can\u2019t\\* use the &lt;include&gt; element from the \u201chttp://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude\u201d namespace, lest it be interpreted as being an instruction for inclusion during processing of the TEI Guidelines.",

Sebastian notes that &lt;table&gt; may suffer from the same problem, and that if &lt;formula&gt; is allowed, then &lt;table&gt; should be since one could use a table in a phrase-level context.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuggested solution:\r\n\r\n1\\) Change content model of &lt;trailer&gt; to be macro.paraContent, or explicitly allow &lt;figure&gt; inside it.  Another possibility would be to change figure to make it model.graphicLike so it would appear anywhere a graphic could...but that might have other unforeseen effects.  Maybe needs more thinking out, but one should be able to provide a figure with a figDesc in or after a trailer.\r\n2\\) Allow a &lt;desc/&gt; child of &lt;graphic&gt;.  One should never be able to provide a graphic without the possibility of something from which to generate @alt text in HTML.\r\n\r\n-James",

So this is a bug in Roma, not in the definition of &lt;egXML&gt;, and I am re-assigning it accordingly.\r\n\r\nThe content of &lt;eg&gt; is defined as text only, since you may want to use it for non-XML data. If you want to put XML inside an &lt;eg&gt; you are recommended to wrap it in a CDATA marked section.\r\n",

  "description": "Version numbers:\r\n\r\nUbuntu: 9.04\r\ntei-xsl: 5.24\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\n\r\nThis is a problem with the LaTeX stylesheet.  I'm attaching a zip file called paranote.zip, it contains files illustrating the problem:\r\n\r\nMakefile      simple makefile to build a PDF out of the XML\r\nmyTEI.rnc     basic RNC created with Roma\r\nparanote.xml  XML file giving examples of the problems reported here\r\nschemas.xml   Keeps nXML happy by linking paranote.xml to myTEI.rnc.\r\n\r\nPeople wanting to use the Makefile should edit the STYLE variable before running make.\r\n\r\nThe file paranote.xml shows 2 related problems:\r\n\r\n1\\. The first problem is with paragraphs inside of notes:\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;note&gt;&lt;p&gt;note contents&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/note&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\nis transformed into a footnote which begins with the \\par command. LaTeX then produces a footnote which begins with a blank line.\r\n\r\n2\\. The second problem is with lines in line groups:\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nFirst example using quote... before lg...\r\n&lt;quote&gt;\r\n&lt;lg&gt;&lt;l&gt;line 1&lt;/l&gt;&lt;l&gt;line 2&lt;/l&gt;&lt;/lg&gt;\r\n&lt;/quote&gt;\r\nAfter lg...\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\nis transformed into a quote which ends with \\\\\\\\.  This line break causes unwanted space in the final document.\r\n\r\nA related case is this one:\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nSecond example using q... before lg...\r\n&lt;quote&gt;\r\n&lt;lg&gt;&lt;l&gt;line 1&lt;/l&gt;&lt;l&gt;line 2&lt;/l&gt;&lt;/lg&gt;\r\n&lt;/quote&gt;\r\nAfter lg...\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\nThe last \\leftline creates an unwanted space.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\n\r\nThe problems here stem for a general problem: some LaTeX commands which are used to separate presentational elements within a larger structure must not be generated at the start or end of that structure.  So to speak of the cases above:\r\n\r\n1\\. Paragraphs in a footnote should not generate \\par if they are first in the footnote.\r\n\r\n2\\. Lines in a line group would not generate \\\\\\ if they are last in the group.  I do not have a good solution for fixing the \\leftline case.\r\n\r\n",

The structured recording of a date happens in the @when or related attributes. The text content could conceivably be the text from the original source that indicates what leads one to believe it is that date.  While that is perhaps far-fetched and it is more usually the human-readable form of the structured date \\(e.g. 'c. early 15th Century'\\), local cataloging guidelines may require the need to encode special formatting of aspects of this.  For example, in Bodleian cataloging guidelines the 'c.' is required to be in italics in the output.  Moreover, local cataloging guidelines may require the use of non-unicode characters.\r\n\r\nFor reasons such as these I would recommend that the content model of origDate be changed to be:\r\n\r\n\\(text | model.gLike | model.hiLike\\)\\* \r\n\r\nor similar.\r\n",

And the fact that a TEI person as experienced and smart as Kevin misconstrues this means it should be more obvious. Perhaps the prose before the list can be updated to make it more obvious where &lt;tagUsage&gt; goes. Or perhaps, since &lt;tagUsage&gt; is \\*never\\* used anywhere else except in &lt;namespace&gt;, this can be made explicit in the &lt;desc&gt; element in the &lt;tagUsage&gt; element spec. \\(And thus that would show up in the list of 3.\\)",

  "description": "The particular problem a user came to me with is that the content model for &lt;div&gt; \\(and also for &lt;body&gt;\\) does not permit a &lt;figure&gt; to occur before a &lt;head&gt;, which is obviously necessary at times. This was allowed in P4, and I think qualifies as a corrigible error.\r\n\r\nBut on some investigation, it turns out not to be a quirk of the confusing content models needed for &lt;body&gt; and &lt;div&gt;, but rather that &lt;figure&gt; does not seem to have the appropriate class membership. It should be allowed much more liberally than its current class membership \\(model.inter, model.titlepagePart\\) permits.\r\n\r\nAt first blush, I can see no reason why &lt;figure&gt; should not be in model.global. After all, where \\*can't\\* a figure go? Surely in a manuscript there are no constraints whatsoever on where an author might have scribbled a figure; and even in print, those typesetters were rarely                                                     considerate of future encoding endeavors.\r\n\r\nIn P4 &lt;figure&gt; was a member of %m.Incl;, which made sense. However, this had the side effect that &lt;figure&gt; was insufficient to satisfy the central portion of the &lt;div&gt; content model. But for better or for worse this is not a problem for P5 &lt;div&gt;, as all content is optional; but it still would occur for P5 &lt;body&gt;, I think \u2014 but this isn't a problem as a &lt;body&gt; probably shouldn't contain nothing but a &lt;figure&gt;, anyway.\r\n",

        "text": "To expand on the relation between this bug and request 1900115:\n\nOne of the items included in that request is to allow figure within bibl, because a figure can actually, even though accidentally, occur within a bibl. I collected some evidence of related phenomena to ponder in this context. See: http://peterboot.nl/tei/figures-everywhere.pdf. What this shows is figures \\(on new pages\\) interrupting rs, quote, list and name. \\(Of these four, quote is the only place where figure is allowed to occur\\). This suggests that figures can indeed occur almost anywhere. That does not necessarily mean figure should be global. Another option would be to split the rs, quote, list or name \\(yes, the quote too, because even though a figure can occur within a quote, this figure is not actually part of the quote\\). That would be the preference of the orthodox, I suppose. On the other hand, we all, I believe, would unhesitatingly place the page breaks inside of these elements. And we already allow graphic there. I think this argues for accepting Syd\u2019s proposal. \n\nAnother item included in 1900115 is to allow a figure where it was allowed in P4: at the end of a div, after a subdivision, like this:\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;figure/&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\nSyd\u2019s proposal solves that problem as well. \n\\(And in fact there are more places where P5 caused a similar problem: between divs and between list items\\). \n",

  "description": "== Description ==\r\n\r\nWhen converting a &lt;ptr target=\"footnoteid\"/&gt; where \"footnoteid\" refers to a footnote, the following code is executed:\r\n\r\n&lt;xsl:template match=\"tei:note\" mode=\"xref\"&gt;\r\n&lt;xsl:number level=\"any\"/&gt;\r\n&lt;/xsl:template&gt;\r\n\r\nHowever, notes are generated using the standard LaTeX \\footnote \\(or \\endnote\\) facility.  It is therefore possible that LaTeX's idea of footnote numbering will differ from XSL's idea.  In trivially simple documents, LaTeX and the XSL fragment above will have the same numbering but in more complex documents, especially documents where &lt;note&gt; can be processed in a number of different ways, the numbers generated by \\footnote and by the fragment above will diverge.\r\n\r\n== Illustration ==\r\n\r\nI am attaching a zip file named teibug4.zip.  It contains files illustrating the problem.  Use make to generate the ltx and pdf files.\r\n\r\nThe file test.xml contains several paragraphs and footnotes.  I've set one footnote to be an endnote.  This example is awkward \\(nobody would use endnotes like this\\) but it does illustrate the problem well enough: if a &lt;note&gt; element is not converted to a footnote, then the numbers generated by &lt;ptr&gt; are off.\r\n\r\nIn the resulting example, you will see in footnote four \"See notes 2 and 3.\"  The number 3 should be 1 because it is a reference to the one &lt;note&gt; element which is actually an endnote.\r\n\r\n== Hackish Workaround ==\r\n\r\nThis is an incomplete solution hacked together to allow me to move forward with my work.  It does not take care of the first cases in the &lt;xsl:choose&gt; test.  I've overridden two templates and use \\ref and \\label to get proper numbers in place.  Note that \\ref ends up appearing inside a \\hyperlink element but this does not seem to bother LaTeX.\r\n\r\n&lt;xsl:template match=\"tei:note\" mode=\"xref\"&gt;\r\n&lt;xsl:text&gt;\\ref\\{&lt;/xsl:text&gt;&lt;xsl:value-of select=\"@xml:id\"/&gt;&lt;xsl:text&gt;\\}&lt;/xsl:text&gt;\r\n&lt;/xsl:template&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;xsl:template match=\"tei:note\"&gt;\r\n&lt;xsl:if test=\"@xml:id\"&gt;\r\n&lt;xsl:text&gt;\\hypertarget\\{&lt;/xsl:text&gt;\r\n&lt;xsl:value-of select=\"@xml:id\"/&gt;\r\n&lt;xsl:text&gt;\\}\\{\\}&lt;/xsl:text&gt;\r\n&lt;/xsl:if&gt;\r\n&lt;xsl:choose&gt;\r\n&lt;xsl:when test=\"@place='inline' or ancestor::tei:bibl or ancestor::tei:biblStruct\"&gt; \r\n&lt;xsl:text&gt;\\(&lt;/xsl:text&gt;\r\n&lt;xsl:apply-templates/&gt;\r\n&lt;xsl:text&gt;\\) &lt;/xsl:text&gt;\r\n&lt;/xsl:when&gt;\r\n&lt;xsl:when test=\"@place='end'\"&gt;\r\n&lt;xsl:text&gt;\\endnote\\{&lt;/xsl:text&gt;\r\n&lt;xsl:apply-templates/&gt;\r\n&lt;xsl:text&gt;\\}&lt;/xsl:text&gt;\r\n&lt;/xsl:when&gt;\r\n&lt;xsl:when test=\"@target\"&gt;\r\n&lt;xsl:text&gt;\\footnotetext\\{&lt;/xsl:text&gt;\r\n&lt;xsl:apply-templates/&gt;\r\n&lt;xsl:text&gt;\\}&lt;/xsl:text&gt;\r\n&lt;/xsl:when&gt;\r\n&lt;xsl:otherwise&gt;\r\n&lt;xsl:text&gt;\\footnote\\{\\label\\{&lt;/xsl:text&gt;&lt;xsl:value-of select=\"@xml:id\"/&gt;&lt;xsl:text&gt;\\}&lt;/xsl:text&gt;\r\n&lt;xsl:apply-templates/&gt;\r\n&lt;xsl:text&gt;\\}&lt;/xsl:text&gt;\r\n&lt;/xsl:otherwise&gt;\r\n&lt;/xsl:choose&gt;\r\n&lt;/xsl:template&gt;\r\n",

  "description": "The definition of the author element is given as the following: \"&lt;author&gt; in a bibliographic reference, contains the name of the author\\(s\\), personal or corporate, of a work; the primary statement of responsibility for any bibliographic item.\" There are a number of problems with this:\r\n\r\n1\\) May an author element contain more than one name, or should there be only one name per author element?  If the latter, how should encoders handle phrases like \"Bill and Melinda Gates\"?\r\n\r\n2\\) May this element contain data that is part of an authority record heading in a library catalog?  For example, the official form of William Shakespeare's name in the Library of Congress name authority file is \"Shakespeare, William, 1564-1616\".\r\n\r\n3\\) Should &lt;author&gt; be used if the referring string that it contains is not actually a name, such as \"unknown\", \"withheld\", or \\(in some cases\\) \"anonymous\"?  Perhaps the use of &lt;persName&gt; and &lt;orgName&gt; as children of &lt;author&gt; should be required to distinguish actual names from \"unknown\" etc.?  The following are examples of what is proposed here:\r\n\r\n\\*  &lt;author&gt;&lt;persName&gt;Shakespeare, William, 1564-1616&lt;/persName&gt;&lt;/author&gt;\r\n\\* &lt;author&gt;&lt;orgName&gt;National Organization for Women&lt;/orgName&gt;&lt;/author&gt;\r\n\\* &lt;author&gt;\\(unknown\\)&lt;/author&gt; \r\n\r\n4\\) As a librarian, I find \"statement of responsibility\" to be problematic since, in cataloguing, the statement of responsibility may be an author, editor, compiler, or whoever else is most prominently credited on the title page, regardless of whether they're an \"author\".  I believe it was not intended that a statement of responsibility of \\*any\\* kind be contained in the author element.",

The broader issue of whether @unit on milestone and refState should be plural needs to be addressed, but @unit is defined separately on those elements \\(they aren't members of att.dimensions\\). \r\n\r\nHowever, it seems to me that the suggested value lists for milestone/@unit and refState/@unit are related, and should be the same, but milestone has two extra values \\(speaker and unnumbered\\). If this is an oversight, they should be brought into alignment, and in fact an attribute class could be created for this @unit \\(distinct from the one defined in att.dimensions\\). If there's a reason for the discrepancy between the value lists, then of course they'll have to remain separately defined on each element.",

  "summary": "ODD specs do not allow starting with non-TEI elements",
  "description": "= Summary =\r\n\r\nIf a user customizes TEI using an ODD specification so as to add non-TEI elements to the schema, then in cases where prefixes must be used it is not possible to have the schema start with a non-TEI element.\r\n\r\n== Versions ==\r\n\r\nUbuntu 12.04.1\r\n\r\n$ dpkg-query -W tei-roma\r\ntei-roma        4.9\r\n\r\n= Observations = \r\n\r\nI have considered that maybe I was trying to do something which the ODD markup was simply not designed for. However, I found the following example\r\n\r\n&lt;schemaSpec prefix=\"TEI\\_\" ident=\"testsvg\" start=\"TEI svg\"&gt;\r\n&lt;moduleRef key=\"header\"/&gt;\r\n&lt;moduleRef key=\"core\"/&gt;\r\n&lt;moduleRef key=\"tei\"/&gt;\r\n&lt;moduleRef key=\"textstructure\"/&gt;\r\n&lt;moduleRef url=\"svg11.rng\"/&gt;\r\n&lt;/schemaSpec&gt;\r\n\r\nFrom the TEI P5 documentation at:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/TD.html\\#ST-aliens\r\n\r\nSo it seems the intent was to have the schemaSpec element be able to specify any random element known to the ODD instance. In the example above, the svg element.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, if prefixes are needed to prevent a name clash between TEI and non-TEI elements, the ODD markup is incapable of specifying a non-TEI starting element.\r\n\r\nThe following discussion makes use of the examples attached to this bug report. To follow, please:\r\n\r\n1\\. Download the attached zip file.\r\n\r\n2\\. Unzip.\r\n\r\n3\\. Execute \r\n\r\n$ make\r\n\r\nRoma will be executed twice. The first run will finish without error.

The first one replicates the example from the TEI P5 documentation, with the necessary changes to make it actually run without errors. The following line specifies that the schema should be allowed to start with TEI or with svg:\r\n\r\n&lt;schemaSpec prefix=\"TEI\\_\" ident=\"testsvg1\" start=\"TEI svg\"&gt;\r\n\r\nHowever the testsvg1.rng and rnc files specify that only TEI may start the document:\r\n\r\n&lt;start&gt;\r\n&lt;choice&gt;\r\n&lt;ref name=\"TEI\\_TEI\"/&gt;\r\n&lt;/choice&gt;\r\n&lt;/start&gt;\r\n\r\nI believe this is because the \"TEI\\_\" prefix is used as follows:\r\n\r\n1\\. It is added to all TEI elements and ONLY TEI elements.\r\n\r\n2\\. It is added to both names in the start attribute.\r\n\r\n3\\. roma tries to resolve TEI\\_TEI, finds a corresponding declaration. No problem. It is one possible start.\r\n\r\n4\\. roma tries to resolve TEI\\_svg, finds no corresponding declaration \\(because of point 1 above\\), silently removes TEI\\_svg from possible starts.\r\n\r\n5\\. roma produces the rng fragment shown above.\r\n\r\nThe second run of roma operates with the following declaration:\r\n\r\n&lt;schemaSpec ident=\"testsvg2\" start=\"TEI svg\"&gt;\r\n\r\nThis generates the proper start because there is no prefix and so all the names in the start attribute resolve without problem:\r\n\r\n&lt;start&gt;\r\n&lt;choice&gt;\r\n&lt;ref name=\"TEI\"/&gt;\r\n&lt;ref name=\"svg\"/&gt;\r\n&lt;/choice&gt;\r\n&lt;/start&gt;\r\n\r\nHowever, it also generates errors because of name clashes between TEI and svg. In effect, the rng and rnc files are invalid.\r\n",

  "description": "In the Guidelines, 3.11.2.3 says:\r\n\r\n\"A bibliographic description, particularly for an analytic title, will often include some additional information specifying its location, for example as a volume number, page number, range of page numbers, or name or number of a subdivision of the host work. The element biblScope may be used to identify such information if it is present. Where it is desired to distinguish different classes of such information \\(volume number, page number, chapter number, etc.\\), the type attribute may be used with any convenient typology.\r\n\r\n\"When the item being cited is a journal article, the imprint element describing the issue in which it appeared may contain biblScope elements for volume and page numbers, together with a date element.\"\r\n\r\nI believe the first paragraph explains how to use a &lt;biblScope&gt; that is not a child of &lt;imprint&gt;, and the second paragraph describes a &lt;biblScope&gt; which is a child of &lt;imprint&gt;.  What makes the description of a journal article different from the description of an analytic title?  I thought a journal article's title is a type of analytic title.\r\n\r\nSo there are a few things that need clarification:\r\n\r\n1\\) Whether the first paragraph's directions about use of biblScope really means to say that it is a sibling, not child, of imprint.\r\n\r\n2\\) Why a journal article is different from an analytic title \\(or other analytic titles\\).\r\n\r\n3\\) Whether, in the case of a journal article, there should be a biblScope sibling of imprint in addition to a child.  It seems that the sibling biblScope would have the page numbers cited and the child biblScope would have the page numbers of the whole article.",

        "text": "There seem to be several quite different issues here.\r\n\r\n1\\. The first paragraph Kevin cites should not be read as implying anything about where exactly a biblScope is located within the biblStruct in question. It does not say anything about the topic, but merely clarifies that additional information may be conveyed by that element.\r\n\r\n2\\. The difference between a journal article and a different kind of analytic article is that the former appears in a journal \\(i.e. a serial of some sort\\). Otherwise there is no difference, vide discussion on the TEI-list last month about Balzac\\!\r\n\r\n3\\. In the case of a journal article \\(or any other analytic title come to think of it\\), the biblScope explaining where the  article \\(or whatever\\) occurs within its monographic parent item can be located anywhere within that item. In the case of a serial, the most convenient place is usually the imprint, but it could also be as a sibling. I am not convinced of the wisdom of giving this distinction additional significance, see below.\r\n\r\n4\\. In my view, the requirement to be able to say \"this is a reference to page4 of an item which occupies pages 3 to 6\" is quite a different issue. If there were four different citations to four different places in the same article you wouldn't want to put the full biblstruct for the article in your bibliography four times, surely? I think the way to do that is to use the &lt;ref&gt; element. &lt;ref target=\"\\#foo\"&gt;p 4&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;ref target=\"\\#foo\"&gt;p 5&lt;/ref&gt; where \\#foo points to a &lt;bib;lStruct&gt; for the whole article with a biblstruct pp 3 to 6.\r\n",

        "text": "Responding to Lou's comment ...\n\n1\\) What's confusing here is that the first and second paragraphs that I cite discuss use of biblScope for volume and page numbers.  It seems like some sort of opposition is being established depending on whether the cited work is a journal article.  If the Guidelines do not mean to prescribe a difference here, these two paragraphs need to be reworded so as not to discuss volume and page numbers twice.\n\n2\\) I can't find the discussion on Balzac.  Please provide a pointer.\n\n3\\) Prescribing a difference would aid in machine processing of citations.  For example, OpenURL resolvers depend on a specific citation structure, so if we don't prescribe one way or the other, even a citation as structured as biblStruct won't be machine-actionable.\n\n4\\) Your example using ref elements describes how you'd encode references to footnotes/endnotes \\(the little inline superscript numbers\\), not the endnotes themselves.  I agree on how you'd encode the references, but you said \"you wouldn't want to put the full biblstruct for the article in your bibliography four times, surely\".  I'm not so sure of this: if I were encoding footnote references for easy machine processing by an OpenURL resolver, I would in fact repeat the biblStruct over and over, though I admit this wouldn't work well if you were trying to represent a print source document that used an abbreviation like \"Ibid.\"\n\nIn any case, I see this as a separate matter.  The question at hand is whether the TEI Guidelines should recommend anything specific regarding placement of biblScope when there's an imprint present.  It would also be helpful to say something about what to do when you have two page number \\(or page ranges\\) given: one for the part cited and one for the item at the analytical level.",

        "text": "Looking at this ticket with fresh eyes, let me summarize the issues.\r\n\r\n1\\) \u00a73.11.2.3 says:\r\n\r\n\"The elements biblScope, pubPlace and publisher constitute the special class model.imprintPart; members of this class may appear with a date inside an imprint element in a specific location within a biblStruct, or alternatively, they may appear alongside any other bibliographic component inside a bibl.\"\r\n\r\nIndeed, all examples given in \u00a73.11.2 show biblScope as a child of imprint.\r\n\r\nHowever, \u00a73.11.2.7 describes use of biblScope as a child \\(not descendant\\) of monogr, located in a particular location \\(contradicting Lou's comment from 2009-06-01 16:22\\).  Furthermore, according to the element definition, biblScope may be a child of:\r\n\r\nmonogr\r\nseries\r\nimprint\r\nbibl\r\n\r\nFurthermore, Laurent's comment from 2009-03-27 06:23 shows a good use case where you would want to allow both types of biblScopes, but Lou suggests in his comment from 2009-06-01 16:22 that you would instead do this with ref elements.  It' not clear whether Lou's proposed method of encoding was meant to be used within a biblStruct/biblFull that describes something like \"page 4 of an item which occupied pages 3 to 6\" or whether it was meant to encode the footnote in the text.\r\n\r\n2\\) \u00a73.11.2.3 has a paragraph beginning \"When the item being cited is a journal article\".  It seems that this is an elaboration of what's described in the previous paragraph \\(about analytic titles\\), and therefore it should be the last sentence of the previous paragraph.  As it is, it appears that journal articles are different from other analytic titles.  An alternative way of resolving this is to insert \"In particular, \" before \"when the item being cited is a journal article\".",

Laurent and I both assumed this would be done using the biblScope element in different locations, but Lou says he wants to use ref for \"page 367 of \\[title\\] which occupies pages 145 to 678 of ....\"\r\n\r\nLou, could you provide an example of encoding, preferably using these same page number for clarity?  You've made broad statements about how to do this \\(on the SF ticket and in your most recent email\\), the details are hazy to me.\r\n\r\nAs for \\(2\\), Lou suggests allowing biblScope only as a child of monogr or series \\(not as a child of imprint\\) and suggests specifying that the content of biblScope describe the pagination etc. of the bibliographic item in the sibling title element.  A few questions here:\r\n\r\na\\) Since you would no longer be able to encode the 367 of \"page 367 of \\[title\\] which occupies pages 145 to 678 of ....\" using biblScope, we would need another mechanism here.  Are you still suggesting use of ref for this?\r\n\r\nb\\) bibl does not require use of analytic, monogr, or series as child elements.  Instead of requiring that biblScope have monogr or series as a parent, wouldn't it be better to forbid use of biblScope inside of imprint?  Or are you explicitly trying to block people from putting biblScope inside of analytic?\r\n\r\n\\--K.\r\n\r\nOn 28/01/2010 17:32, Lou Burnard wrote:\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; We have two issues, I suggest:\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; 1. Is a reference like \"page 3 of \\[title\\] which occupies pages 145 to\r\n&gt; 678 of ....\"\r\n&gt; the same kind of animal as \"\\[title\\] which occupies pages 145 to 678 of\r\n&gt; ....\"?\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; I feel that it is not, hence my suggestion that it should be treated as\r\n&gt; a &lt;ref&gt; rather than a &lt;biblStruct&gt;. But I can see why people might\r\n&gt; disagree and I don;t think it matters that much\\(you can always wrap your\r\n&gt; &lt;ref&gt; in a &lt;bibl&gt; if you like\\)\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; 2. More problematic, is the possible location/s of &lt;biblScope&gt; within\r\n&gt; &lt;biblStruct&gt;. Reviewing the examples \\(for &lt;imprint&gt;\\) in the Guidelines,\r\n&gt; it's clear that we're not completely inconsistent about whether\r\n&gt; &lt;biblScope&gt; should appear as a child or as a sibling of it -- this is\r\n&gt; partly because I did try to make it consistently a child, rather than a\r\n&gt; sibling, the last time we discussed this issue, but some examples got\r\n&gt; away \\(e.g. Nelson80\\) ... but in any case, I now feel this was a mistake\r\n&gt; and that &lt;imprint&gt; should contain information \\*only\\* \"relating to the\r\n&gt; publication or distribution of a bibliographic item\" i.e. who dunnit,\r\n&gt; when and where. I don't think the \"where\" justifies adding information\r\n&gt; about which volume to look in to find the item concerned. Note that we\r\n&gt; also have &lt;extent&gt; information \\(\"three volumes\"\\) which is a sibling, not\r\n&gt; a child , of &lt;imprint&gt;. So the parent for &lt;biblScope&gt; should always be a\r\n&gt; &lt;monogr&gt; or a &lt;series&gt;, and it should always be a sibling of the &lt;title&gt;\r\n&gt; \\(at whatever level\\) for the item being documented.\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;&gt; Hi there,\r\n&gt;&gt; I have read this again \\(probably the 5th time\\) and I see a conceptual\r\n&gt;&gt; stumbling block on the issue of \"what does a bibliographical reference\r\n&gt;&gt; refer to\". One this is solved, we may just find an easy solution to\r\n&gt;&gt; the biblScope question. Let me try to express one \\(possible\\) semantics\r\n&gt;&gt; for &lt;biblStruct&gt; and see the possible consequences:\r\n&gt;&gt; We could see biblStruct as providing a piece of information containing\r\n&gt;&gt; both descriptive and locative data for it \\(yes, I know this all about\r\n&gt;&gt; metadata....\\). The locative information is there to allow someone to\r\n&gt;&gt; retrieve the actual piece of information, possibly in its context.\r\n&gt;&gt; If one wants to refer to a full paper, the situation is easy: the\r\n&gt;&gt; biblScope in &lt;imprint&gt; give the place \\(in relation to volume, issue\r\n&gt;&gt; information\\) of this same paper.\r\n&gt;&gt; If one want to refer to a specific page, I would say, this is exctly\r\n&gt;&gt; the same, the biblScope in &lt;imprint&gt; should contain the page information.\r\n&gt;&gt; All in all, this means I was wring when trying to have two\r\n&gt;&gt; &lt;biblScope&gt;'s at two different places. It may be the case that we\r\n&gt;&gt; could \"impose\" that &lt;biblScope&gt; should only occur in &lt;imprint&gt; and\r\n&gt;&gt; provide a clear theory of reference for this.\r\n&gt;&gt; Am I getting stupid?\r\n&gt;&gt; Laurent\r\n&gt;&gt;\r\n&gt;&gt;\r\n&gt;&gt;\r\n&gt;&gt; Le 27 janv. 10 \u00e0 20:17, Kevin Hawkins a \u00e9crit :\r\n&gt;&gt;\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Lou?\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; On 08/12/2009 14:55, Kevin Hawkins wrote:\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; To make sure we're all not waiting on each other, I believe Lou\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; needs to\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; take the next step with this ticket:\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=2714682&group\\_id=106328&atid=644062\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; He'll look at the prose revision in \\(2\\).

In \"NELSON80\" biblStruct example, move &lt;biblScope type=\"pp\"&gt;1013\u201323&lt;/biblScope&gt; into the imprint element just above it.\r\n\r\n2\\. In PMLA example, change &lt;biblScope type=\"pages\"&gt;122&lt;/biblScope&gt; to &lt;biblScope type=\"pp\"&gt;121-139&lt;/biblScope&gt; and insert &lt;biblScope type=\"pp\"&gt;122&lt;/biblScope&gt; after &lt;/imprint&gt;.  \\(The value of @type is the practice prescribed in section 3.11.4 and used elsewhere, so we should fix it while we're making other adjustments to this example.

Then, after the above sentence, add the following:\r\n\r\nIn biblStruct or biblFull, the element biblScope may appear as a sibling or child of imprint.  Use of each is described below.\r\n\r\n4\\. Revise this sentence:\r\n\r\nWhen the item being cited is a journal article, the imprint element describing the issue in which it appeared may contain biblScope elements for volume and page numbers, together with a date element. \r\n\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\nWhen biblStruct or biblFull is used, and when the item being cited is a journal article, the imprint element describing the issue in which it appeared may contain biblScope elements for volume and page numbers, together with a date element, indicating the location of the analytic item.

Revise the \"Parish registers and the historian\" example to include &lt;biblScope type=\"pp\"&gt;161&lt;/biblScope&gt; after &lt;/imprint&gt; and add the following sentence after the example:\r\n\r\nIn the above example, the article is found on pp. 155-167, but only p. 161 is cited by the author of the text.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of other changes to section 3.11 that should be made for greater internal consistency of the Guidelines and to promote best practice -- some of which were mentioned in the discussion below.

Download the attached zip file.\r\n\r\n2\\. Unzip.\r\n\r\n3\\. Edit the Makefile so that STYLE points to where your copy of the LaTeX stylesheet is.\r\n\r\n4\\. Execute make.\r\n\r\n5\\. You will get a pdf file showing the visual symptoms described above.  Moreover if you inspect the ltx file you will see that \\mainmatter is called when the real main matter of the text starts but is also called a second time due to the &lt;body&gt; present in the &lt;floatingText&gt;.\r\n\r\n=== Observations ===\r\n\r\nThis problem does not occur if there is no &lt;front&gt; element in the document.\r\n\r\nFor my own purposes, I solved the problem by making sure that the children of &lt;floatingText&gt; are processed in the \"innertext\" mode.\r\n\r\nAnother possibility would be have the following template do its tests against preceding siblings rather than just any preceding element:\r\n\r\n&lt;xsl:template match=\"tei:body\"&gt;\r\n&lt;xsl:if test=\"not\\(preceding::tei:body\\) and preceding::tei:front\"&gt;\r\n&lt;xsl:text&gt;\\mainmatter &lt;/xsl:text&gt;\r\n&lt;/xsl:if&gt;\r\n&lt;xsl:apply-templates/&gt;\r\n&lt;/xsl:template&gt;\r\n\r\nBut I do not know whether it would cause more troubles down the road.\r\n",

Download the attached zip file.\r\n\r\n2\\. Unzip.\r\n\r\n3\\. Edit the Makefile so that STYLE points to where your copy of the LaTeX stylesheet is.\r\n\r\n4\\. Execute make.\r\n\r\n5\\. You will get a pdf file.\r\n\r\n=== Actual Results ===\r\n\r\nThe pdf shows that the \"After list\" string appears at the start of a new paragraph.  In the xml file though, the \"After list\" string is part of the same paragraph as \"Before list\".\r\n\r\nThe ltx file shows that there is a blank line after \\end\\{itemize\\}. This extra blank line starts a new paragraph.\r\n\r\n=== Expected Results ===\r\n\r\nBoth \"After list\" and \"Before list\" should be in the same paragraph.\r\n\r\n=== Workaround ===\r\n\r\nThe test.xml file also contains a workaround: \"Workaround before\" and \"Workaround after\" are both in the same paragraph despite the list which appears in the paragraph.  The workaround consists in just continuing the rest of the paragraph on the same line where the &lt;/list&gt; tag appears.  \r\n\r\nHowever, such workaround is likely to be undone by most kinds of editors which attempt to reflow xml in a visually pleasant manner.\r\n\r\n=== Observations ===\r\n\r\nThe test.xml file also shows that any blank line in the middle of a paragraph in the input xml will create a new paragraph in the final pdf.  I do not know whether there is a sane way around this.  I've always avoided that situation in my files.\r\n",

For the /en/ version of the guidelines it is assumed that all examples are in Modern English unless otherwise stated.  So this list must look at all examples where language isn't specified and double-check that they are indeed in Modern English.  Other divisions such as 'Early Modern English' will be ignored and counted as Modern English since I do not believe it has an ISO language code of its own.\r\n\r\nWe'll add the results of our investigations to this ticket.\r\n\r\n-James\r\n",

A bit later in the current tagdoc there is a note contradicting this (\"The `<add> element should not be used for additions made by editors or encoders. In these cases, either the <corr> or <supplied> element should be used.`\") This inconsistency reflects a long-standing debate both in the TEI community and beyond. The original TEI position, reflected in the `<desc>`, was to avoid taking a position, but subsequent users have taken the view (reflected in the note) that markup should always mark only what's visible on the page. I think we need to revise the text to make clear that both options are tenable, but that projects may well wish to be explicit about which they prefer. Certainly we should not continue to contradict ourselves.\r\n ",

However, the Guidelines rendering code automatically pretty-prints them in indented format, adding whitespace where there shouldn't be any. We should decide whether this is important or not; if it is, then rendering of such elements in examples should be tweaked so that the original whitespace content is exactly preserved.",

I suspect this might be an unwanted by-product of the change which put element names into alphabetical order. It also appears in the rendering of attribute classes:\r\n\r\n<http://teijenkins.hcmc.uvic.ca/job/TEIP5/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-att.coordinated.html>\r\n\r\nbut it doesn't appear to affect the rendering of element lists in \"Contained by\" or \"May contain\" boxes in regular element definitions. This looks to be a simple fix but we should make sure it gets done before the next release.",

In KHML no attempt was made to indicate the natural language of particular chunks of text. However, each metadata record contains a \u201cmyLangs\u201d field, which contains 1 to 20 BCP 47 tags, which indicate every language that occurs in the text of the document.\r\n\r\nSo given a KHML text that has \"en de la\" in its \u201cmyLangs\u201d field, what should Kevin do to convert to TEI? He can\u2019t automatically put xml:lang= on individual elements in the text, and he can\u2019t afford to pay someone to read his large corpus and put them on by hand.\r\n\r\nThere are two other obvious possibilities. The first is to use &lt;textLang&gt;. This has three disadvantages:\r\n1\\. It\u2019s part of msdescription module, not header module\r\n2\\. It is not permitted inside &lt;teiHeader&gt; except as a child of an msElement of some sort\r\n3\\. It intends, if not requires, that the languages present be divided into one \u201cmain\u201d and zero or more \u201cother\u201d \\(a distinction KHML does not make\\).\r\n\r\nThe other possibility is to use &lt;langUsage&gt; for this purpose:\r\n&lt;langUsage&gt;\r\n&lt;language ident=\"en\"/&gt; &lt;language ident='de'/&gt; &lt;language ident=\"la\"/&gt;\r\n&lt;/langUsage&gt;\r\n\r\nHowever, I am uncomfortable with this use. While the Guidelines do not explicitly prohibit this, there is an implication that the presence of a langUsage/language/@ident implies that there exist elements with xml:lang= values that match the value of the ident=.\r\n\r\nThis could be fixed, of course, by putting a sentence and perhaps example in the Guidelines that license this usage of &lt;langUsage&gt;. But I think before that is done, Council should seriously consider Kevin\u2019s suggestion \\(or a variation thereof\\).\r\n\r\nI have two suggestions:\r\n1\\) Putting &lt;textLang&gt; inside of &lt;langUsage&gt; instead of a series of &lt;language&gt; elements. I.e., \r\nelement langUsage \\{ \\( language+ | textLang \\) \\}\r\n\\(This does not address the mainLang= vs. otherLangs= problem.\\)\r\nOR\r\n2\\) Putting a langs= attribute on &lt;langUsage&gt; to be used instead of a series of &lt;language&gt; elements. I.e. something like the following.\r\n&lt;content&gt;\r\n&lt;rng:zeroOrMore xmlns:rng=\"http://relaxng.org/ns/structure/1.0\"&gt;\r\n&lt;rng:ref name=\"language\"/&gt;\r\n&lt;/rng:zeroOrMore&gt;\r\n&lt;/content&gt;\r\n&lt;constraintSpec scheme=\"isoschematron\" ident=\"langUsage\"&gt;\r\n&lt;constraint&gt;\r\n&lt;s:rule context=\"tei:langUsage\"&gt;\r\n&lt;s:report test=\"@langs and child::tei:language\"&gt; Natural\r\nlanguages used within the text should be listed\r\nbriefly on the &lt;att&gt;langs&lt;/att&gt; attribute or, for\r\nmore detailed encoding \\(like recording the\r\npercentage of each language used, or when the\r\npassages in particular languages have been indicated\r\nwith &lt;att&gt;xml:lang&lt;/att&gt;\\), using &lt;gi&gt;language&lt;/gi&gt;\r\nchild elements, but not both. &lt;/s:report&gt;\r\n&lt;/s:rule&gt;\r\n&lt;/constraint&gt;\r\n&lt;/constraintSpec&gt;\r\n&lt;attList&gt;\r\n&lt;attDef ident=\"langs\"&gt;\r\n&lt;datatype minOccurs=\"1\" maxOccurs=\"unbounded\"&gt;\r\n&lt;rng:ref name=\"data.language\"/&gt;\r\n&lt;/datatype&gt;\r\n&lt;/attDef&gt;\r\n&lt;/attList&gt;\r\n\r\nEither of these suggestions has the benefit of differentiating the two cases \\(mentioning the languages used, vs providing detailed information\\) very explicitly right up front. One can imagine that when doing language processing of large corpora it is far more efficient to be able to look for the existence of /TEI/teiHeader/profileDesc/langUsage/language/@ident rather than for /TEI/text\\[@xml:lang\\]|/TEI/text//\\*\\[@xml:lang\\].",

  "description": "In P5, 16.1.2 gives nice examples of how to encode complicated footnotes assuming there is no footnote reference in the text \\(like a superscript number\\).  You can either use \"implicit pointing\", putting the note element at the point of reference, or use \"explicit\" pointing, with a ptr element at the point of reference.\r\n\r\nBut what if there is a superscript number?  Should you use ptr or ref?  My inclination is to use ref, similar to the second TOC example in 4.5 \\(which has page number references, unlike the first TOC example\\).  It seems to me that footnote references are such a common encoding need that P5 should be explicit about how to do this \\(with an example\\).",

But it is what the TEI Guidelines explicitly recommended in P2 \\(6.8.1\\), P3 \\(6.8.1\\), P4 \\(6.8.1\\), and P5 \\(3.8.1\\). To suggest the reverse -- as has now been codified at r6937 -- seems like a step backwards, a step away from consistency, harmony, and what little interoperability there may be in the TEI universe.\r\n\r\nFor years I have told people that it doesn't really matter whether the anchor \\(typically a content element like &lt;name&gt;, or an attachment flag encoded as &lt;anchor&gt;, &lt;ptr&gt;, or &lt;ref&gt;\\) points to the note or vice-versa. But since the TEI Guidelines recommend that the &lt;note&gt; point to the &lt;anchor&gt; \\(or whatever\\), that is the way they should do it. The logic was that because the TEI Guidelines chose one of these two essentially equivalent methods, everyone would use it, and we'd all share the benefits of doing things the same way.\r\n\r\nOf course, for those who like belts and suspenders, the anchor can also point back to the note. \\(Using target= or corresp=.\\)\r\n",

  "description": "== Summary ==\r\n\r\nIf a table contains in its first row a cell which spans multiple columns, running the XSLT version 2 stylesheets on an XML document conforming to a vanilla TEI schema results in incorrect LaTeX code.\r\n\r\n== Versions ==\r\n\r\nUbuntu 10.4\r\n\r\n$ dpkg-query -W tei-p5-xsl2\r\ntei-p5-xsl2     5.30\r\n\r\n== How to Reproduce ==\r\n\r\n1\\. Download the attached zip file.\r\n\r\n2\\. Unzip.\r\n\r\n3\\. Edit the Makefile so that STYLE points to where your copy of the XSLT 2 version of the LaTeX stylesheet is.\r\n\r\n4\\. Execute \r\n\r\n$ make test.pdf\r\n$ make test2.pdf\r\n\r\n== Actual Results ==\r\n\r\nMaking either test.xml or test2.xml results in the following error at the stage of running LaTeX on the output of the XSL transformation:\r\n\r\n\\! Extra alignment tab has been changed to \\cr.\r\n\r\n== Expected Results ==\r\n\r\nThere should be no error. That is, correct LaTeX code should be generated.\r\n\r\n== Observations ==\r\n\r\nThe test.xml and test2.xml files provided to illustrate the bug contain two different ways of encoding a table. I've searched the P5 Guidelines but was not able to find a directive as to how \"merged cells\" are supposed to be handled to conform to P5. \\(I've also searched previous bug reports and did a general Google search.\\) Let me explain. According to the LaTeX model, if one uses \\multicolumn to make a cell span multiple columns, then the cells which are merged with this cell are not encoded separately. So if a table has a total of 3 columns and a cell spans 3 columns then this row will contain only one cell, the one encoded by \\multicolumn. Other table models require that merged cells be encoded as separate empty cells.\r\n\r\nSo I've tried both models without knowing which one is mandated by P5. At any rate, neither model works:\r\n\r\n1\\. When processing test.xml, the stylesheet determines the number of columns by counting the number of cell elements. It ignores the presence of the \"cols\" attribute so it incorrectly computes a table of 2 cells. When the cells in the first row are processed, it results in a row of 3 cells: one regular cell plus the \\multicolumn command which adds 2 cells.\r\n\r\n2\\. When processing test2.xml, the stylesheet determines the number of columns by counting the number of cell elements. In this case, there is an empty cell standing in for the cell which ends up being merged with the &lt;cell cols=\"2\"&gt; cell. So the number of columns computed is correct: this is a table of 3 columns. However, when the first row is processed, the stylesheet produces a row of 4 cells: one regular cell plus the \\multicolumn command which adds 2 cells and the empty cell at the end of the row results in another cell in the LaTeX output.\r\n\r\n3\\. The file test3.xml was added to show that if:\r\n\r\na\\) one follows the LaTeX model for encoding spanning cells \\(i.e. cells whose space is taken up by a cell spanning multiple columns are NOT encoded in the XML\\), and\r\n\r\nb\\) spanning cells appear ONLY ELSEWHERE than the first row,\r\n\r\nthen the LaTeX output is correct, as far as column and cell accounting is concerned anyway. \\(There seem to be a presentation issue but I'm not going to investigate that now.\\)\r\n\r\nI've grepped through the Test files bundled in tei-p5-test but was not able to find a case with a table containing a cell spanning multiple columns.\r\n\r\n4\\. The file test4.xml was added to show a partial workaround: use a preamble attribute to manually create a correct table preamble. Unfortunately this attribute requires the schema to be customized.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the preamble attribute is not enough to produce a correct table. I noticed the color of the multicolumn cell in test4.pdf is incorrect. If I add \"\\)\\{\\columncolor\\{label\\}\\}\" in the second argument of the \\multicolumn command generated by the stylesheets, this fixes the color.\r\n\r\n5\\. The presence or absence of the \"cols\" attribute on the \"table\" element has no effect whatsoever.\r\n\r\n",

  "description": "\r\nThere are many places where &lt;graphic/&gt; is allowed in which you might want the rendered version of that &lt;graphic/&gt; to contain a descriptive metadata about it the image in question. i.e. the information you might want to supply to an @html:alt attribute when rendering.  Currently there is no good way I can see to do this?  Certainly figDesc exists when describing figures, but nothing similar exists for &lt;graphic/&gt;\r\n\r\nA use case for this is &lt;graphic/&gt; as a child of &lt;char&gt;, especially when you have multiple &lt;graphic/&gt;s at that point.  e.g. you have the character as rendered by one font or another version of that font, or another font entirely.\r\n&lt;char xml:id=\"whatever\"&gt;\r\n&lt;desc&gt;Punctus Elevatus&lt;/desc&gt;\r\n&lt;graphic url=\"punct-el-JR.png\"&gt;&lt;desc&gt;Punctus Elevatus as rendered by the Junicode Regular Font&lt;/desc&gt;&lt;/graphic&gt;\r\n&lt;graphic url=\"punct-el-JI.png\"&gt;&lt;desc&gt;Punctus Elevatus as rendered by the Junicode Italic Font&lt;/desc&gt;&lt;/graphic&gt;\r\n&lt;graphic url=\"punct-el-And.png\"&gt;&lt;desc&gt;Punctus Elevatus as rendered by the Andron Web Scriptor Font&lt;/desc&gt;&lt;/graphic&gt;\r\n&lt;/char&gt;\r\n\r\nIt seems silly to have to move this burden to processing and to substring-matching to then test everthing after the second - but before the .png to see which font it is, to create the equivalent of an @html:alt attribute.  Since all html:img elements should have @alt attributes to comply with web accessibility guidelines, I think we need a way to store the text that would be used to make this @alt attribute at the site of the &lt;graphic/&gt; element.  Other alternatives include a @desc attribute or similar but that is a step backwards into the icky free-text attribute days. Another possiblity would be to allow macro.xtext inside graphic and state that this was a description of the graphic \\(not a transcription\\).\r\n\r\n-James",

Download the attached zip file.\r\n\r\n2\\. Unzip.\r\n\r\n3\\. Edit the Makefile so that STYLE points to where your copy of the XSLT 2 version of the LaTeX stylesheet is.  \\(To reproduce the bug for sure, you should use either one of the two versions I indicate above.\\)\r\n\r\n4\\. Execute \r\n\r\n$ make test.pdf\r\n\r\n== Actual Results ==\r\n\r\nGo to page 3 of the resulting PDF. Notice how the table itself is labeled \"Table 1.1\" but the reference to the table at the top of the page says \"Table 1\".\r\n\r\n== Expected Results ==\r\n\r\nThe number in the reference and the number in the table caption should be the same.\r\n\r\n== Observations ==\r\n\r\nIt is not clear what the total set of conditions must be for this bug to happen but one condition is that the root &lt;TEI&gt; must have @rend = 'book'.\r\n\r\nThe problem is due to the processing code for &lt;table&gt; using \\caption\\{\\} to generate the table number whereas the processing of &lt;ptr&gt; uses &lt;xsl:number&gt; to generate a number. In effect, LaTeX is responsible for assigning a number to the table but the XSL processor is responsible to assigning a number to the reference. Since LaTeX and the XSL processor do not necessarily have the same idea of numbering styles and counts, the numbers selected by the two may not be in step.\r\n",

I was just going to fix this by changing the &lt;valDesc&gt;s to \u201can integer number greater than or equal to zero\u201d, when I noticed that the &lt;remarks&gt; of the \u2018data.count\u2019 tagdoc says \u201cOnly positive integer values are permitted\u201d where the datatype clearly permits 0. Personally, it would never occur to me to limit a count to positive numbers \u2014 zero is a perfectly reasonable count. But I found myself wondering if TEI really wants to have \u2018data.count\u2019 exclude 0 as a possible value, as there are contexts where 0 makes no sense \\(e.g., rows=, cols=, maxOccurs=\\). I think the answer is \u201cno\u201d, although in some cases an extra restriction that the count cannot be 0 is appropriate. \\(Or a different datatype\\).\r\n\r\nOn further investigation I found at least one case where data.count is \\(IMHO\\) used inappropriately: group= of att.damaged. I am not sure why the grouping would be limited to numbers in the first place, but it is not a count in any case.\r\n\r\nThere are two cases where nonNegativeInteger is used directly, as opposed to via data.count, and I think these are both appropriate:\r\nlanguage/@usage\r\natt.personal/@sort\r\n\r\nThe attributes defined as data.count are:\r\natt.damaged/@group\r\natt.tableDecoration/@rows\r\natt.tableDecoration/@cols\r\natt.transcriptional/@seq\r\ntagUsage/@occurs\r\ntagUsage/@withId\r\nrefState/@length\r\nlayout/@columns\r\nlayout/@ruledLines\r\nlayout/@writtenLines\r\nhandDesc/@hands\r\natt.textCritical/@varSeq\r\nage/@value\r\ntable/@rows\r\ntable/@cols\r\ngraph/@order\r\ngraph/@size\r\nnode/@inDegree\r\nnode/@outDegree\r\nnode/@degree\r\ntree/@arity\r\ntree/@order\r\nroot/@outDegree\r\niNode/@outDegree\r\ndatatype/@minOccurs\r\ndatatype/@maxOccurs\r\n\r\nAll tests against revision 6658.\r\n",

  "description": "Relevant version string:\r\n\r\n\"This is Roma version 3.12, last updated 2009-07-13. Using TEI P5 version 1.4.1. Last updated on July 1st 2009.\"\r\n\r\n\\(Note that the bug was also happening on the version of Roma released just before this one.  Travel prevented me from releasing the bug report before the new version was released.\\)\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n============\r\n\r\nThis is a complicated bug.  I'm going to provide a summary.  However, the steps to reproduce the bug are many so I've made a desktop recording which I'm hosting here:\r\n\r\nhttp://lddubeau.com/downloads/tei-bug-20090720.ogv\r\n\r\nI would have attached the recording to this bug report but SourceForge does not accept large attachments.\r\n\r\n\r\nSummary\r\n=======\r\n\r\nBasically, it appears that just navigating the GUI \\*without requesting changes\\* causes Roma to still make some changes to the customization behind the scenes.  In the following description, the user creates an initial schema and then inspects elements and attributes without requesting changes.  In the following description, all the saved files are attached to this bug report in a zip file called myTEI.zip\r\n\r\n1\\. The user creates a customization from a minimal schema.  He adds the \"test\" element and adds to this element the \"test1\" attribute.  He saves the rnc as myTEI-1.rnc and the customization as myTEI-1.xml.  Up to this point everything is normal.\r\n\r\n2\\. The user then goes back to check on the \"test\" element and clicks \"Save\" WITHOUT actually making any changes.  When he returns to the \"Schema\" tab, he is greeted with the following error message:\r\n\r\n\r\nYour schema is not valid\\!\\!\r\n\r\nDOMDocument::relaxNGValidate\\(\\) \\[function.DOMDocument-relaxNGValidate\\]: Did not expect element classes there\r\nDOMDocument::relaxNGValidate\\(\\) \\[function.DOMDocument-relaxNGValidate\\]: Element elementSpec has extra content: classes\r\nDOMDocument::relaxNGValidate\\(\\) \\[function.DOMDocument-relaxNGValidate\\]: Element moduleRef has wrong namespace: expecting http://www.ascc.net/xml/schematron\r\nDOMDocument::relaxNGValidate\\(\\) \\[function.DOMDocument-relaxNGValidate\\]: Element schemaSpec has extra content: moduleRef\r\nDOMDocument::relaxNGValidate\\(\\) \\[function.DOMDocument-relaxNGValidate\\]: Element TEI failed to validate content\r\n\r\nHe saves the rnc as myTEI-2.rnc and the customization as myTEI-2.xml.  Note here that, upon cursory inspection, myTEI-2.rnc seems to be valid.\r\n\r\n3\\. The user then goes back to check on the \"test1\" attribute of the \"test\" element.  When presented with the list of attributes, he clicks \"Save\" WITHOUT actually making any changes.  When he returns to the \"Schema\" tab, the error message remains the same. He saves the rnc as myTEI-3.rnc and the customization as myTEI-3.xml.\r\n\r\n\r\nObservations\r\n============\r\n\r\n1\\. It appears that the difference between myTEI-1.xml and myTEI-2.xml is the location of the &lt;attList&gt; element.  This is clearly visible when using ediff to compare the two files.\r\n\r\n2\\. It appears that the difference between myTEI-2.xml and myTEI-3.xml is that the \"mode\" attribute on the definition of the \"test1\" attribute goes from \"add\" to \"change\".  Again, ediff shows this clearly.\r\n\r\n3\\. There is no significant difference between myTEI-1.rnc and myTEI-2.rnc.  \\(Only a timestamp changes.\\)\r\n\r\n4\\. myTEI-3.rnc differs from the two other rnc files in that the \"test1\" attribute is missing.  This is probably related to observation 2 above.\r\n\r\n5\\. Going to the \"Sanity Checker\" tab to check the schema does not result in any significant error message.  The checker always say \"Schema is CORRECT\\!\", no matter whether it is checking myTEI-1.rnc, myTEI-2.rnc or myTEI-3.rnc.\r\n",

The guidelines text was changed at the same time to read, \"contains the formalized descriptive title for a meeting or conference, for use in a bibliographic description for an item derived from such a meeting, or as a heading or preamble to publications emanating from it.\" The intent was clearly to permit more general use of &lt;meeting&gt;, within an unstructured &lt;bibl&gt; or at the head of a division.\n\nSo... the expectation that it might be allowed within &lt;titleStmt&gt; seems legitimate. There are two ways to accomplish this:\n\n1\\. by adding it explicitly;\n\n2\\. by adding it to model.respLike \\(moving it there from model.biblPart, really\\)\n\nThe negative to \\#1 is mainly that this would be an ad hoc addition to titleStmt \\(and why not allow in that case various other elements?\\)\n\nThe negative to \\#2 is that all elements now in model.respLike are more or less \"personal\" \\(author editor funder principal respStmt sponsor\\). On the other hand, a funder or sponsor can be corporate entities, with statuses not too different from that of a \"meeting\". Also, elements in model.respLike are used by model.msItemPart; &lt;meeting&gt; doesn't make a lot of sense in that context.\n\nDS suggests that \\#2 is a marginally better option, to avoid the single ad hoc addition of &lt;meeting&gt; to &lt;titleStmt&gt;.",

  "description": "In proofreading a DH proposal for a colleague this morning I've read through Guidelines section 7.2.2 \\(http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/DR.html\\#DRSP\\) and found what I believe are errors \\(or issues\\) simply because the language is out of date. Specifically, the existing text refers to IDREFS and doesn't take into account the existence of the namesdates module.\r\n\r\nCurrently:\r\n\r\n\"The value of the @who attribute however is a unique code, probably made up by the transcriber, which will unambiguously identify the character to whom the speech is assigned. To enforce this uniqueness, the base tag set for drama defines the value of this attribute as IDREFS. This means that the codes included in it must correspond with codes which are specified elsewhere in the document as identifiers for particular elements, typically the role element in the cast list where the character is named or described, as discussed in 7.1 Front and Back Matter  above.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps it could be rewritten something like this: \r\n\r\n\"The value of the @who attribute however serves to unambiguously identify the character to whom the speech is assigned. Having the datatype data.pointer, @who may point to a person element in the TEI header \\(http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/CC.html\\#CCAHPA\\), to a role element in the cast list \\(http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/DR.html\\#DRCAST\\), or to any external source that may be referenced via a URI.\" \r\n\r\nI realize this is following the \"hunt and peck\" approach to Guidelines development, but unless there is a strong feeling that the entire chapter should be re-evaluated I hope we can agree to make this relatively minor but nevertheless important change. I've also added this as a feature request.",

This is a bit beyond my level of knowledge of XML/TEI, and I'm not sure of the protocol here, but I'll submit this as a bug if you agree.",

        "text": "It makes perfect sense to me.  The principle \\(as already stated\\) is that the application should produce a schema based on the value in &lt;val&gt;, not @ident.  However, @ident is retained to avoid breaking apps that assume \\(as stated in the Guidelines\\) that \"All documentation elements in ODD have a canonical name, supplied as the value for their ident attribute\" and also as a fallback value. If it were being redesigned from scratch, there might be a better way of doing it, but this solution shouldn't cause any headaches as long as it's carefully documented.\n\nAs regards languages, I think you're confusing &lt;gloss&gt; with &lt;altIdent&gt;.  In the example, the &lt;valItem xml:lang=\"es\"&gt; is the equivalent of what would normally be &lt;altIdent xml:lang=\"es\"&gt;.  Of course there's no urgent need to retain &lt;altIdent&gt;s as there is for @ident, but a careful user might include one as a fallback.\n\nSo essentially, both @ident and &lt;altIdent&gt; are superseded by valItem/val elements.  However, valItem/@ident is not \"language-independent\" but inherits from previous @xml:lang atttributes, though whether applications properly respect this when generating schemas and documentation I don't know.  Taking Syd's example for reference, it might have been written like this:\n\n&lt;TEI xml:lang=\"en\" ...&gt;\n...\n&lt;valItem ident=\"HR\"&gt;\n&lt;val&gt;heart rate&lt;/val&gt;\n&lt;val xml:lang=\"es\"&gt;tarifa coraz\u00f3n&lt;/val&gt;\n&lt;/valItem&gt;\n...\n&lt;/TEI&gt;\n\nas the equivalent of:\n\n&lt;TEI xml:lang=\"en\" ...&gt;\n...\n&lt;valItem ident=\"HR\"&gt;\n&lt;altIdent xml:lang=\"es\"&gt;TC&lt;/val&gt;\n&lt;/valItem&gt;\n...\n&lt;/TEI&gt;\n",

We could consider renaming the\r\n@version you get from att.translatable to \"translateDate\" or some\r\nsuch; so far as I know the attribute is only used for internal ODD\r\nprocessing by the TEI so the compatibility issue is less severe. Note\r\nthat the semantics of this @version are quite different from the\r\nothers -- it carries the date when an ODD component was last\r\n\\*translated\\* which is usually quite different from when the ODD\r\ncomponent itself was last modified, and nothing to do with the version\r\nnumber of the P5 release into which that component was eventually\r\nincorporated.\r\n\r\nThere is an outstanding issue about how the @version on these\r\ntranslateable elements should be used in our workflow specifically how we ensure consistency when the English language version has changed and\r\nthe translations have not.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Whilst this is often the case, there are many cases \\(for instance, collections of correspondence\\) where leaves are of differing sizes.  It would be helpful if @from, @to and @scheme \\(as per &lt;locus&gt;\\) could be added in order to accomplish this.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of a real-world case:\r\nFolios 1-13 measure 315-320mm high by 205mm wide and fol. 14 measures 220mm by 205mm. All other leaves measure 295-300mm by 205mm with the following exceptions: fol. 15 \\(175mm x 140mm\\), fol. 46 \\(77mm x 252mm\\), fol. 81 \\(200m x 142mm\\), fol. 87 \\(134mm x 190mm\\), fol. 97 \\(112mm x 123mm\\), fol. 99 \\(70mm x 127mm\\), and fols. 141-169 \\(188mm x 150mm\\).",

  "description": "1\\. It seems potentially misleading that after characterizing pointers as pointer elements \\(&lt;ptr/&gt; and friends\\), the chapter uses the term \"pointer\" when defining the TEI XPointer schemes. Because those \"pointer\" arguments are to be treated as resource identifiers, perhaps the best fix could be to replace e.g. range\\(pointer, pointer\\) with something ugly like range\\(res-ident, res-ident\\).\r\n\r\n2\\. There is a mistake in 16.9.5: \"the expression range\\(/1/2/1.0,/1/2/11.1\\) will select the whole poem\" should be \"the expression range\\(element\\(/1/2/1.0\\),element\\(/1/2/11.1\\)\\) will select the whole poem\"\r\n\r\n3\\. Next, consider fn. 52 and 53:\r\n\r\n52: \"bare names \\(i.e. values of xml:id references\\) \"\r\n53: \"Bare names \\(i.e., xml:id  values\\)\"\r\n\r\nI might try to interpret 52 as assuming that a reference to an xml:id \\(e.g. '\\#a'\\) has the value 'a', but why complicate the matters and terms. Say \"xml:id values\" in both cases instead.\r\n\r\n4\\. Another thing is that, as far as I know, the term \"bare name\" \\(or maybe even \"barename\"\\) is deprecated and replaced with \"shorthand pointer\". But perhaps that shouldn't influence the text of the Guidelines, because \"bare name\" is much more intuitive. Still, a footnote might be in order, and the normative reference here is the xptr-framework document \\(http://www.w3.org/TR/xptr-framework/\\).",

Are you seriously proposing that the TEI should invent a third set of normalizations, neither one nor the other? That might make sense if it supported an intersection of the two, but not if it was a superset. When we looked at this before, we concluded that we just had to live with both, and force people to be explicit about which they are using. Hence the uncomfortable existence of the two sets of attributes. It might, I suppose, be argued that instead of mapping \\(eg\\) @when to @when-w3c, we should support only @when-w3c, but that seems like needlessly cruelty.\r\n\r\n",

Gabriel B also agreed with this.\n\nThere is one unaddressed issue here: if we use nesting to describe relationships, do we nest logically \\(where the \"analytic\" bibl is a child of the \"monogr\" bibl, and the \"monogr\" bibl is a child of the \"series\" bibl\\), or do we nest in a way that mimicks &lt;biblStruct&gt; \\(where analytic, monogr and series are all siblings inside the container &lt;biblStruct&gt;?

Like this:\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n&lt;figure&gt;\r\n&lt;graphic mimeType=\"image/jpg\" url=\"tei images/DSCN2303-bw.jpg\"/&gt;\r\n&lt;head xml:id=\"image\\_DanishMembers\"&gt;The Danish Members of the Expedition&lt;/head&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n&lt;table rows=\"1\" cols=\"4\"&gt;\r\n&lt;head&gt;Photographed at West Greenland&lt;/head&gt;\r\n&lt;row&gt;\r\n&lt;cell&gt;Kaj Birket-Smith&lt;/cell&gt;\r\n&lt;cell&gt;Therkel Mathiassen&lt;/cell&gt;\r\n&lt;cell&gt;Helge Bangsted&lt;/cell&gt;\r\n&lt;cell/&gt;\r\n&lt;/row&gt;\r\n&lt;row&gt;\r\n&lt;cell&gt;Peder Pedersen&lt;/cell&gt;\r\n&lt;cell&gt;Knud Rasmussen&lt;/cell&gt;\r\n&lt;cell&gt;Peter Freuchen&lt;/cell&gt;\r\n&lt;cell&gt;Jacob Olsen&lt;/cell&gt;\r\n&lt;/row&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/figure&gt;\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\nWith the table numbering set to 'true' in the stylesheet parameters it appends the text \"Table 1.\" to the \"Photographed at West Greenland\" text in the table &lt;head&gt; tag in the HTML output - this would be the expected behaviour. If I set the parameter to 'false' however it replaces the text in the HTML output with the text \"this table\", and the \"Photographed at West Greenland\" has been stripped from the output.\r\n\r\nthanks\r\nGary",

The tei-to-epub stylesheet collects them at the bottom of the html page as expected but it is also appending a copy to the bottom of the index.html page which contains information from the title page. In the source code it looks as if it is outputting it as part of it's processing of the back matter. I've attached the file for you to see.\r\n\r\ncheers\r\nGary",

Titled \"Default\" which has no align attribute.\r\n\r\n2\\. Titled \"Left\" which has the middle cell with the attribute \"align\" set to \"left\".\r\n\r\n3\\. Titled \"Center\" which has the middle cell with the attribute \"align\" set to \"center\".\r\n\r\n4\\. Titled \"Right\" which has the middle cell with the attribute \"align\" set to \"Right\".\r\n\r\n5\\. Titled \"Center w/o role attribute on cell\" with has the middle cell with the attribute \"align\" set to \"center\".\r\n\r\nI would expect the following:\r\n\r\n1\\. Table 1 and 2 should look the same because \"Left\" alignment is the default.\r\n\r\n2\\. Table 2, 3 and 4 should look different because the alignment of the middle cell is different. In other words, changing the alignment should change the alignment and nothing else.\r\n\r\n3\\. Table 5 should look the same as table 3. As per the TEI documentation on the \"role\" attribute, when role is set on a row, all the cells of this row have the role of the row, unless overridden on the cell themselves.\r\n\r\n== Actual Results ==\r\n\r\nThe expectations in the previous section are not met.\r\n\r\n== Observations ==\r\n\r\nThe upshot of all this is twofold:\r\n\r\n1\\. The align attribute results in \\*differences\\* in the LaTeX code generated \\*only when\\* the \"role\" attribute is set to \"label\" on the cells where specific alignments are desired.\r\n\r\n2\\. The LaTeX code generated by the stylesheet does not result in the expected aesthetic differences.\r\n\r\nI realize align is not part of TEI proper but looking at figures.xsl, it seems that the intent behind implementing code for an align attribute is not being realized in a consistent way.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, it seems that the fo2 code handles alignment in a way which is not compatible with the latex2 code. There, the relevant attribute is called halign, for one thing.\r\n",

This differs from the online Guidelines at http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/index.html, where each reference page includes a section labeled \"In addition to global attributes\", which not only indicates the relevant attribute classes but also documents any individual, not-in-a-class attributes.\r\n\r\nThis is particularly problematic when a project adds a new, project-specific attribute for an existing element. If the attribute is not added as a member of a class, that attribute is not documented anywhere other than the ODD source for the project's schema \\(since of course it's not something one can look up on the relevant reference page of the online TEI Guidelines\\).\r\n",

However, Stuart's original point concerned the element pages, and there I think the change may be useful to have. \r\n\r\nTo make sure: not within the chapter, but in the element pages, I think it might make sense to either replace \"dictionary\" altogether or to use \"lexical resource/database\" alongside it, e.g., in the definition for \"entry\", instead of \"contains a reasonably well-structured dictionary entry\", we could have \"contains a reasonably well-structured entry in a lexical resource, e.g. a dictionary\".

  "description": "It might already exist but is there a way to pass &lt;q&gt; tags through to the xhtml. CSS stylesheets let you control the style of quotes \\(eg. guillemets instead of quote marks\\) and provide a way of handling nested quotes \\(eg. singles within doubles\\). The current method seems to allow you to choose only one sort of pre and post quotes and doesn't handle nested quotes.\r\n\r\nthanks Gary",

And it recently got some templates for CES and OTA, which probably illustrates my point very well, because it shows that the scripts drift apart, the 2.0 version, part of the Stylesheets package, not having the functionality that the 1.0 script has now, but being generally newer and described with oXygen documentation elements, which the 1.0 script lacks in turn.\r\n\r\nMaybe one of them should go, or, if you want to maintain both 1.0 and 2.0 versions for some reason, perhaps they should become skeletons including the common subset of templates, for ease of maintenance.",

On \nthose grounds, I'd point out ...\n\n\\(1\\) that @role on &lt;cell&gt; \\(and on &lt;row&gt;\\) is very handy, \nalmost essential in capturing tables. It is the\nbest way to capture the basic distinction between\na data cell and a heading cell \\(or row\\), i.e. between\nan HTML &lt;td&gt; and &lt;th&gt;. It is well within the capability\nof keying vendors to make this distinction most\nof the time.\n\n\\(We also use @role=\"total\" on cells and rows to\ndenote cells in arithmetical tables that contain\ntotals \\(sums\\), subtotals, products, etc., and are\noften distinctively rendered and should be\ndistinctively displayed. This too is very useful.\\)\n\n\\(2\\) that @resp on &lt;gap&gt; and &lt;unclear&gt; serves to distinguish\nomissions \\(e.g. because of illegibility\\) made by\nthe keying vendor from those made by the inhouse\neditors. The former are presumably more likely to\nbe subject to further review, so it is a distinction\nworth preserving, at least in some version of the\nschema. \\(You don't mention @resp as being among those\neither removed or retained, so I do not know its\nstatus.\\)\n\n\\(3\\) that you'll need some way to distinguish \\(at least\\)\nin-line &lt;figure&gt;s from 'block' &lt;figure&gt;s of various\nkinds. With @place removed, you're left accomplishing\nthis with @rend. That is how we do it, in fact, but is\nis your intention to load @rend that way?\n\n\\(4\\) that though we've used @extent on &lt;gap&gt; rather than\n@unit/@quantity, we've been told that the latter would\nhave been a better choice: easier to process, at least.\nWas the decision in favor of @extent an advised one?\n\nThat's all. The rest of the omissions would not affect us.\n\npfs\n\n",

It seems to me that Tite is designed only for use by vendors, so in-house staff would use a slightly looser schema that includes things like gap@resp and unclear@resp.  Therefore, I don't think we need to retain @resp on either of these elements.\n\nPaul also comments on use of @extent vs. use of both @unit and @quantity on &lt;gap&gt;.  Tite includes gap@unit and gap@quantity, which he says is the generally advised way to do things, so I don't see any reason for us to object to getting rid of gap@extent.\n\nIt seems that Apex is not currently distinguishing between phrase-level \\(in-line\\) and chunk-level \\(block\\) &lt;figure&gt;s.  I welcome thoughts from others on whether we should retain figure@place in Tite to indicate this \\(for any vendor that might want to do so\\), or whether we should leave figure@rend for this.\n\nI think we can all agree with Lou on rewriting the Tite ODD as he describes.",

Sometimes it includes the whole caption, sometimes just a lead-in word like \"Above:\", and sometimes nothing.  I don't oppose taking this to TEI-L, and I only suggested it here because, often enough in such cases, Lou explains what he means by this or that element and then we clarify the Guidelines accordingly.

A classic case is the title page of E M Forster's \"Howards End\" \\(1902\\) , on the title page of which appears the phrase \"Only connect\". This is not the title, nor is it a quotation from anyone else,  it's an epigraph. \r\n\r\nSo if there's a fault to be corrected here it is that we don't have a wider range of examples in the Guidelines, in my opinion, not that the specification is insufficiently narrow.\r\n\r\n",

I can't see sensible cases where we could expect phrasal content to be put within &lt;tns&gt; or &lt;per&gt;, which should perhaps ideally be empty elements with maybe @corresp pointing to a definition in the header or the front matter or elsewhere. Possibly allowing rng:text for the sake of a more editorial kind of view. In other words, I question the placement of the borderline that needs to be catered for in this case.\r\n\r\nAt this point, someone should invoke \\*print\\* dictionaries, and especially historical editions, and some potentially cute stuff one might find in their grammatical descriptions; my answer would be to question the use of the precisely defined elements such as &lt;per&gt;, &lt;number&gt;, etc. for such a purpose. Each of these pieces of information refers to \\(what should be\\) a well-defined set of symbolic values -- there is no place for a &lt;quote&gt; or &lt;bibl&gt;, or even a &lt;list&gt; inside them. \r\n\r\nI realise that I am presenting a narrowly focused view, this is intentional.

Earlier versions of the Guidelines make clear that the intention was to distinguish four situations :\r\n\r\nrequired: the attribute or element must be supplied in all situations\r\n\r\nmandatory when applicable: the attribute or element must be supplied in certain situations \\(e.g. where other elements require its presence\\)\r\n\r\nrecommended : good practice suggests that the attribute or element should be supplied, but it is not required\r\n\r\nrecommended when applicable : same again, but only in certain circumstances\r\n\r\noptional : always entirely optional\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, I am quite sure that we have over the years forgotten about this distinction, and applying it retrospectively would be a nightmare. More seriously, we now have a much more robust and well thought out definition of TEI conformance which makes these distinctions unnecessary. So I have no problem with nixing all occurrences of it -- but it is NOT synonymous with \"optional\"\\!\r\n\r\np.s. grep is as good way as any of finding the existing cases -- just do grep mwa \\*.xml in the Specs directory\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I would change @break to this for the reasons that Martin Mueller has often articulated on TEI-L: that inconsistent handling of hyphenation is the greatest barrier to interoperability he has encountered.

  "description": "Over the past few years, there has been some discussion of what to do about attributes such as @key, which have \"magic token\" values. The general feeling has been that they should be deprecated in favour of attributes such as @ref which take data.pointer values, and that the Guidelines should be updated to show clear examples of how to use data.pointer when you don't have a reliable or practical URL to point at \\(essentially, when you actually do want a magic token\\). So this:\r\n\r\nkey=\"myThing\"\r\n\r\ncould be this:\r\n\r\nref=\"local:myThing\"\r\n\r\nusing a private scheme. Other attributes that ought to be addressed at the same time include:\r\n\r\n@lemma \\(data.key\\)\r\n@loc \\(1\u2013\u221e data.word\\)\r\n@cRef \\(1\u2013\u221e data.word\\)\r\nmetSym/@value  \\(1\u2013\u221e data.word\\)\r\n\r\nall of which, I think, might be better served by @ref or @target.\r\n\r\nThere has been a lengthy discussion of this in Council recently starting here:\r\n\r\nhttp://lists.village.virginia.edu/pipermail/tei-council/2011/013761.html\r\n\r\nand a previous discussion minuted here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.tei-c.org/Activities/Council/Meetings/tcm45.xml\r\n\r\nThis FR is also related \\(although it would presumably be declined given the previous discussions\\):\r\n\r\nhttps://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=2919640&group\\_id=106328&atid=644065\r\n\r\nOn that ticket, Sebastian suggests:\r\n\r\na\\) actually use URNs in their full raging glory, as in \r\n&lt;p facs=\"urn:www.ox.ac.uk:P45\"&gt;Hello world&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\nb\\) invent an arbitrary schema, which means something to you:\r\n\r\n&lt;p facs=\"oxpics:P45\"&gt;Hello world&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\nc\\) use \"tag URIs\" as documented in RFC 4151\r\n\\(http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4151.txt\\)\"\r\n\r\n&lt;p facs=\"tag:indiana.edu:P45:&gt;Hello world&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\nThis ticket invites preliminary discussion about:\r\n\r\n\\- Whether we want to deprecate some or all of these attributes\r\n\r\n\\- What precise recommendations we want to make to encourage people not to use them\r\n\r\n\\- Exactly which attributes we should be concerned about",

The existence of a distinct attribute to specify them, which by definition has a value that is not necessarily a URI, seems very useful and appropriate. The question raised on FR 644065 has to do with the specific case of an attribute which is defined as \\*not\\* taking a magic token, but for which we would like to supply something like one, tricked out in some way as if it were a kosher URL. That surely is what URNs were invented for, so I see no problem in using them: in whatever syntactic form we can identify.  I think it would definitely be a mistake to just \"deprecate @key\". It has its place. We just need to  be clear and consistent about what that place is.",

While this might be a bug in Roma, based on Sebastian's comment I took it to indicate that we incorrectly allow moduleSpec, moduleRef, specGrp, etc. outside of schemaSpec whereas the intention of the ODD system was for all of these elements to be within a single--or maybe multiple--schemaSpecs.

I do have a use-case, namely when you actually make declaration all over the place in a document, referring to a schema \\(key?, ref?\\) which is defined elsewhere \\(e.g. at the end\\). Going in this direction of a decentralized literate programming, would allow one to actually expect to see the corresponding documentation occur where it is declared, without having to rely on a specDesc for instance. For those like who did fancy ODD files, it simplifies the drafting by having documentation and specification at the same place as one writes. \r\nFor instance, when one describes the specific customization for a given module, he could open a division for this, put the moduleRef at the same place and carry on documenting the reason for a customization element per element. \r\nI'm not saying it would be easy to implement, though.",

I'm now working on ways to take the resulting data in spreadsheet form an automatically merge it back into the specifications. At the moment, I think this has to be done in a three-stage process:\r\n\r\n1. Download the spreadsheet as ODS, and save ans FODS for simplicity's sake (only one file to deal with).\r\n\r\n2. Manually search-and-replace the escaped angle-brackets in the text:p nodes which contain stretches of TEI encoding in escaped form. I think this must be done manually because while in most cases, bits like this: `&lt;listBibl&gt;` can be converted to `<tei:listBibl>`, in other cases the angle brackets are mentioned rather than used: `a pi (processing instruction), with delimiters &lt;? and ?&gt; is intended`. My preliminary trial suggests that a global search-and-replace in Oxygen with the XPath context \"text:p\" of `&lt;(/?)` for `<tei:$1` and `&gt;` for `>` will get it right in all but a dozen or so cases; a well-formedness check will then find those cases and they can be fixed manually.\r\n\r\n3. Run an XSLT transformation that processes the new translations into the spec files. I've done a little preliminary work on that.",

  "description": "I was recently tasked with adding &lt;respStmt&gt; to &lt;imprint&gt; \\(ticket \\#3408897\\). In the process of doing that, I encountered some difficulties with the model system which forced me to add &lt;respStmt&gt; manually to the content model of &lt;imprint&gt;, rather than using a class. I think this reveals some problems that need to be addressed.\r\n\r\nmodel.imprintPart \"groups the bibliographic elements which occur inside imprints.\"\r\nmodel.biblPart    \"groups elements which represent components of a bibliographic description.\"\r\n\r\nmodel.imprintPart contains: \tdistributor publisher biblScope pubPlace\r\nmodel.biblPart    contains:     model.respLike \\[sponsor funder principal author editor respStmt meeting\\] model.imprintPart \\[distributor publisher biblScope pubPlace\\] edition extent series bibl relatedItem msIdentifier\r\n\r\nIn other words, model.biblPart includes model.imprintPart as well as model.respLike; that was the root of my difficulty, because if I added &lt;respStmt&gt; to model.imprintPart, it would end up being included twice in model.biblPart, once as part of model.respLike and once as part of model.imprintPart. I think there are two specific issues here:\r\n\r\n1\\. Other elements in model.respLike deserve to be in model.imprintPart. Sponsors and funders can perfectly well be associated with an imprint. However, these would also have to be added as individual elements to avoid this conflict.\r\n\r\n2\\. Some elements currently in model.imprintPart \\(distributor and publisher\\) actually deserve to be in model.respLike, because they are \"responsibilities\" in the same way that sponsor or funder are.\r\n\r\nI think the cleanest solution to this problem would look like this:\r\n\r\n1\\. Add distributor and publisher to model.respLike.\r\n\r\n2\\. Remove model.imprintPart from model.biblPart.\r\n\r\n3\\. Replace the remaining two elements of model.imprintPart \\(biblScope and pubPlace\\) in model.biblPart.\r\n\r\n4\\. Remove respStmt from the content model of imprint, and add it instead to model.imprintPart.\r\n\r\nThis would have the desired effects of making model.imprintPart and model.biblPart logically complete \\(they contain everything that they look like they ought to contain\\), and make them both useful as models.\r\n",

        "text": "Regarding Martin's two specific issues in his ticket:\r\n\r\n\\(1\\): Martin writes, \"Sponsors and funders can perfectly well be associated with an imprint.\"  By \"imprint\", does he mean \"a particular edition\" \\(as people sometimes use \"imprint\" to mean\\) or actually \"the publication or distribution of an item\"?  If he means a particular edition, then &lt;sponsor&gt; or &lt;funder&gt; should just be a sibling of &lt;edition&gt;.  If he really means the latter, I'm skeptical that there are any title pages out there that really state that a particular sponsoring or funding organization was responsible for publication or distribution but not for the production of the item.\r\n\r\n\\(2\\): I believe model.respLike was created for those children of &lt;titleStmt&gt;, &lt;bibl&gt;, and later &lt;msItem&gt; that indicate responsibility.  Despite its name, it is not for all elements indicating responsibility.  Now, I see that &lt;meeting&gt; is a member of this group, which goes against my characterization that these all \"indicate responsibility\", but I imagine it was added to this model class simply because it should be allowed in the same places as the other elements in this class -- which is evidence that what really characterizes this model class is that it's for children of &lt;titleStmt&gt;, &lt;msItem&gt;, and &lt;bibl&gt; that are not included in other model classes.\r\n\r\nSo I agree with Lou that &lt;distributor&gt; and &lt;publisher&gt; should not be added to model.respLike, but I also think that we should rethink inclusion of &lt;meeting&gt; in model.respLike.  Either we redefine this model class to describe what it actually contains \\(which would end up being ex post facto\\) or we create more complicated content models for &lt;titleStmt&gt;, &lt;msItem&gt;, and &lt;bibl&gt; in order to include &lt;meeting&gt; in these directly.",

In this way it is very much \r\nlike &lt;list&gt; itself, which can be inline in a pararaph, or a sibling to a \r\nparagraph.  &lt;signed&gt; can be a sibling to a paragraph \\(at the bottom of a \r\ndiv\\) and is joined in model.divBottom with &lt;trailer&gt;, &lt;closer&gt;, and \r\n&lt;postscript&gt;. &lt;signed&gt; can I was surprised to see that neither &lt;trailer&gt; \r\nnor &lt;closer&gt; allow a &lt;list&gt; child either, but that &lt;postscript&gt; does. \r\nThis is because &lt;postscript&gt; is sort of like a &lt;div&gt; in that it can \r\ncontain paragraphs \\(and thus things like &lt;list&gt; which appear between \r\nparagraphs\\) whereas the others are like things which appear inside \r\n&lt;div&gt;s. I realise I'm repeating the obvious here, I'm just thinking things through.\r\n\r\nThe current content models, ignoring attribute classes, are:\r\n\r\nsigned: macro.phraseSeq\r\ntrailer: macro.phraseSeq\r\nmacro.phraseSeq=\\(text|model.gLike|model.phrase|model.global\\)\\*\r\ncloser: \\(text|model.gLike|model.phrase|model.global|signed|dateline|salute\\)\\*\r\npostscript: \\(\\(model.common\\)|\\(model.global\\)\\)\\*\r\n\r\nSo &lt;closer&gt; is exactly the same as &lt;signed&gt; or &lt;trailer&gt; except that we \r\nhave specifically added &lt;signed&gt;, &lt;dateline&gt;, and &lt;salute&gt; to this to \r\nallow it to group them. This, and the examples, encourages me in my \r\nconclusion that we have intended &lt;signed&gt; to function either as \r\nsurrounding a single signature or as a signature block containing the \r\nclosing salutation text as well as the signature. Partly because of \r\nthis, and partly because of the examples given, I find the argument for \r\nincluding list \\(or model.listLike\\) generally persuasive.\r\n\r\nAlthough I'm loathe to recommend further opening the floodgates of \r\nbizarre stuff that is allowed in inappropriate places, the only \r\ndifference between the content model of a paragraph, and that of \r\n&lt;signed&gt; and &lt;trailer&gt; \\(and arguably &lt;closer&gt;\\) is that a paragraph also \r\nallows model.inter \\(which has elements which appear either within or \r\nbetween paragraphs, like lists\\).\r\n\r\nmacro.phraseSeq=\\(text|model.gLike|model.phrase|model.global\\)\\*\r\nmacro.paraContent=\\(text|model.gLike|model.phrase|model.global|model.inter\\)\\*\r\n\r\nIf we changed &lt;signed&gt; and &lt;trailer&gt;'s content model to \r\nmacro.ParaContent this would allow &lt;list&gt; there, and have no \r\nbackwards-compatibility implications. We could change &lt;closer&gt; to be the \r\nsame but with signed|dateline|salute as it currently has. I'd recommend \r\nchanging both &lt;signed&gt; and &lt;trailer&gt; in tandem for consistency between \r\nelements in model.divBottom but I could be argued out of that.\r\n\r\nHowever, I'd suggest that we explain that &lt;signed&gt; can be used both as a \r\nsingle signature and as a block containing salutation text and \r\nsignature\\(s\\), but that the better encoding is to use &lt;closer&gt; with \r\n&lt;salute&gt; for the salutation text if possible. Both its description and \r\ndiscussion in the prose of the Guidelines should make this clear.\r\n\r\nMy two pence,\r\n\r\n-James\r\n",

However, the Guidelines say:\r\n\r\n\"All uses of geo within a document are required to use the same coordinate system, which is that defined by a geoDecl element supplied in the TEI Header. If no such element is supplied, the assumption is that the content of each geo element will be a pair of numbers separated by whitespace, to be interpreted as latitude followed by longitude according to the World Geodetic System.\"\r\n\r\nNo-one seems to know why this restriction exists. Syd B suggests that &lt;geo&gt; should be made a member of att.declaring, so that individual &lt;geo&gt; elements can be associated with distinct &lt;geoDecl&gt; elements in the header. ",

Similar arguments were advanced wrt calendar normalisation. As we have now added support for normalised dates using different systems, I suppose that counts as a precedent. I entirely agree with Syd's original comment -- that if geoDecl is a member of att.declarable, then geo should be a member of declaring: in fact I think that's a simple corrigible bug. I am not persuaded by the arguments for making &lt;location&gt; declaring however, nor for permitting multiple &lt;location&gt;s. I think Martin's usage is unnecessarily inconsistent with the Guidelines specification for &lt;geo&gt;.  &lt;location&gt; is explicitly defined as defining its parent &lt;place&gt;, and should therefore be thought of as a unique identifier.",

It's true that a coordinate pair will be the most common content, but what do we want to recommend for people who want, like Martin, to represent a polygon or polyline?\r\n\r\nI was thinking that a useful rule might be to follow an existing standard like gml:posList, but that expects coordinate pairs to be comma-delimited, and lines/polygons to be made up of a space-delimited list of such pairs. This is the opposite of what we seem to suggest now, and would therefore break a lot of people's usage.\r\n\r\nAny other suggestions?\r\n\r\n\\(Final question: do we also want to give some guidance under &lt;geoDecl&gt; about how to define more than one datum and refer back to them?\\)",

However, I believe that the section in Chapter CH which covers language identification \\(CH.html\\#CHSH\\) should be reviewed and compared against the latest version of BCP 47, which was updated in September 2009, and in particular in view of the fact that RFC 5646 superceded 4646 at the same time; I have updated the CH chapter to show 5646, but we should review the new version and make sure our recommendations still fit with it.\r\n\r\nWhile we're at it, we should address this ludicrous description for @xml:lang values:\r\n\r\n\"The value must conform to BCP 47. If the value is a private use code \\(i.e., starts with x- or contains -x-\\) it should, and if not it may, match the value of an ident attribute of a language element supplied in the TEI Header of the current document.\"\r\n\r\nI can't figure out what was intended by \"it should, and if not it may\", but it shouldn't and it may not be left like that, surely.\r\n\r\n",

It just happens too often that  a seemingly redundant comment actually helps explain a problem, or alerts us to something that might become one.

The Council telco minutes say: \r\n\r\n\"MH's previously circulated report discusses the blacklisting of URLs derived from some TEI identifiers such as \\#MSAD. After reflection, Council agreed with his recommendation that all existing identifers should be given a unique prefix such as \"TEI\\_\" ; it was also agreed that this could be done at the next available release. since it would not involve any schema change. SR and MH to confer on implementation before next P5 release. \"\r\n\r\nWhen SR and MH conferred, the agreed solution was to add the prefix in processing during the creation of the web guidelines; the assumption was that everyone wanted to keep the same ids \\(which are nice and short\\) throughout the source, and only change them when rendering the guidelines for the web, because it's only in the HTML output that this particular issue occurs; no reason presumably to burden the ePub output \\(for instance\\) with hundreds of longer ids.\r\n\r\nIt proved quite difficult \\(for me, anyway\\) to make this work. The only way I could do it reliably and simply was to pre-process p5.xml to add the prefixes in various locations \\(@xml:id, @target, @corresp\\), and this results in changes to the filenames of the chapters in output; the filenames are somewhat tangled up with ids. \r\n\r\nChanging long-established filenames would result in broken links on the website, so that solution probably isn't acceptable. Another alternative would be to post-process the HTML pages, but that would add significantly to the build time.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the comment below by LB, and one by JC on the Council list, suggest that others understood this to mean that the ids would be permanently changed in the P5 source. This is presumably relatively easy to do \\(although I suspect there would still be some interaction between the chapter ids and their filenames\\). At the same time, the problem which gave rise to this ticket has not resurfaced; the one remaining AdBlock list which did not respond to our request for a change \\(Fanboy\\) now seems to be moribund as of August 2012. So I'm going to set this ticket to Pending; if the problem ever re-emerges, we'll have a record of what was discussed and tried. If it never comes back in a year or so, we should just close the ticket.",

The trick is to deal with the countless sorts of misalignment that can occur. My current approach is working well so far. For each corpus, I adopt a canonical segmentation. This usually exists already, but if not, the encoder picks one. Then all DIVs \\(or DIV-like things\\) in each text get tagged with a starting cRef if the beginning of the subject DIV lines up with the beginning of the canonical DIV, an ending cRef if the ends line up, or both, or neither. The stylesheet uses these to align the texts. No single encoded text need exactly use the canonical segmentation. The element refsDecl tells encoders of subsequent text \\(another translation, another edition, etc.\\) what canonical segmentation to use.\n\nAt first, I put the starting cRef in &lt;head&gt; and the ending cRef in &lt;tail&gt;, but semantically that's bad. Then I learned how to use Roma and so I added cRefStart and cRefEnd as attributes to DIV and DIV-like things. I now think I should also add cRefMiddle, but I haven't done that yet.\n\nI have written enough of the XSLT alignment code \\(a lot of graph algorithms in XSLT\\!\\) to convince myself the model is pretty good. I can successfully handle many kinds of misalignment. And the few cases I cannot handle could get covered by addition of a cRefMiddle.\n\nA cRefStart and a cRefEnd can be any string, and it can include spaces, so \"Editor's Preface\", \"Translator's Preface\", \"John 3:16\", \"Aphorism XII\" are all valid and all indicate just one cRef. There cannot be more than one cRefStart or cRefEnd for each DIV. I do not allow more than one canonical segmentation per corpus.\n\nAs I said, I don't have it all working yet, but I figured that if it does work, I would propose adding these markers to the standard or at least let people know about them and share my stylesheets. I know there is a lot of interest in parallel corpora and it really is a gnarly problem. I'm finding something in the spirit of cRef is helping me solve it.\n\n\n\n",

But I concluded that the atomic unit for alignment would best be a structural division as a unit and not a point in the text. Bekker numbers \\(page, column and line number\\) in Aristotle, for example, a perfect example of a milestone, would not be used for alignment, but book and chapter numbers would be. I display Bekker numbers but I don't use them for alignment. \n\nThis choice to use structural units for alignment rather than textual milestones promised to solve several alignment problems, and so far, it's working out well. I'm optimistic that I'll succeed where others have been stymied.\n\nSeparately then, could I use &lt;milestone&gt; to encode the structural boundaries? I could but decided against it. If the marks are really attributes of the division, they should be attributes of the DIV.\n\nSaid differently, I found it better to have a DIV announce to the world, \"I begin where canonical chapter 1 begins and I end where canonical chapter 2 ends,\" than for a DIV to stay silent and have those divisions marked in the text.\n\nThe structural alignment also seems to match the way users think of parallel texts: \"This edition combined chapters 2 and 3 into one chapter.\" \"This translation left out the prologue of each section.\" \"This manuscript skipped paragraph 3 but included the epilogue.\"",

If genName's can be used for something else, we need an example to show this \\(and an explanation why they are called genName's\\).

As we failed there, the rule of least effort should presumably apply.\r\n\r\n3\\. \"possibly including any or all of the person's forenames, surnames, honorifics, added names, etc\" I think it would be a mistake to delete \"possibly\".

Thus \"William the younger\" vs \"William the fat\". \\(By the way, we dont mark plurals with an apostrophe in conventional British English\\)\r\n\r\n5 \"cater for every personal name and processing need.\" is a rather too condensed way of saying \"cater for every personal name, or for every  processing requirement\"\r\n\r\n6\\. \"The components of an organization's name are not always personal names.

If A is the spouse of B, B is the spouse of A, and that's all there is to it. However, there's no way of detecting that the @active attribute is not appropriately used without understanding the semantics of the relationship itself. You would need schematron rules \\(or similar\\) which listed all named relationships and identified the \"directionality\" of each. This is probably one of the reasons why the Ontology workgroup is proposing revisions for the &lt;relation&gt; element.\n\nBrasserie Georges address according to its website, and indeed my last two visits there, is  30 Cours de Verdun;  don't know why we located it in rue de la charite, which is miles away \\(tho does also have some good restaurants\\). So I  am happy to change the street name; however, I think that the 2nd arrondissement of Lyon \\(where it is located\\) is usually referred to as Perrache, as in the original text. I certainly don't think we should introduce an additional &lt;district type=\"quarter\"&gt; since \"quarter\" means nothing in French. Its equivalent \\( \"quartier\"\\) does, but it's closer to the Br E word \"neighbourhood\".\n\n\"These classes, originally intended to provide attributes \u2018describing the nature of an encoded scholarly intervention or interpretation of any kind\u2019 make available the attributes cert, to indicate the degree of certainty, resp, the agency responsible, and evidence, the nature of the evidence used.\"\n\nI agree that the clause \"originally intended...of any kind\" adds nothing useful to this sentence; it should be deleted.\n\n",

Square brackets and other ad hoc markup aside, \"unattested\" probably does not occur anywhere: here it is used to indicate a conjectural form - one could also contest whether such a form is a reading and belongs in &lt;rdg&gt; \\(or &lt;lem&gt;\\). I don't think TEI has an elegant way of noting conjectural forms, unless they occur in an apparatus one is transcribing.

According to the Guidelines, \"&lt;wit&gt; contains a list of one or more sigla of witnesses attesting a given reading, in a textual variation.\" and this does not fit the notation \"\\[unattested\\]\".\r\n\r\nMore generally, I would like to see clearer advice in the Guidelines about how to encode conjectures within &lt;app&gt;. This both applies to any conjectures one might make oneself and conjectures made by others that one wishes to transcribe.",

        "text": "Actually I think there's a broader misunderstanding at work in many of the examples of &lt;metDecl&gt;, and a weakness in the whole method of encoding. The idea, as I understand it, is that the &lt;metDecl&gt; pattern is meant to supply broad constraints with which metrical structures in the text conform. So you would have, for instance:\r\n\r\n\\- in the header, three &lt;metDecl&gt; elements which define possible patterns to which poetic lines are expected to conform\r\n\r\n\\- in the text, poetic lines, each of which has an @met attribute which shows an actual pattern which conforms with one of the &lt;metDecl&gt; elements in the header.\r\n\r\nHowever, as far as I can see, there's no way to say, in the context of the line, which &lt;metDecl&gt; pattern a given line is supposed to conform to \\(at least, no such method is documented\\). So if I have, for instance:\r\n\r\n&lt;metDecl xml:id=\"type1\" pattern=\"\\[abc\\]+\"&gt;...&lt;/metDecl&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;metDecl xml:id=\"type2\" pattern=\"a\\[bc\\]+&gt;...&lt;/metDecl&gt;\r\n\r\nand then I have in the text, a line like this:\r\n\r\n&lt;l met=\"acbc\"&gt;...&lt;/l&gt;\r\n\r\nthere's no documented way for me to say that this line is an instance of \\#type1 or \\#type2. In this manufactured example, it conforms to both.\r\n\r\nI believe there should be a documented method of linking a block element with metrical structure to the @xml:id of a &lt;metDecl&gt; element. This may consist of @corresp, but even so it should be documented; actually I think it should consist of a new @metDecl attribute.\r\n\r\nAm I misunderstanding or missing something here? I haven't used these metrical structures much in P5.",

Would not an acceptable answer be to use the @decls attribute on the surrounding &lt;div&gt; or whatever? That can point to the @xml:id of the appropriate metDecl.

If you wish to distinguish between characteristics that are generally perceived to be time-bound states and those assumed to be fixed traits, then trait is available for the more static of these. The state element encodes characteristics which are sometimes assumed to change, often at specific times or over a date range, whereas the trait elements are used to record characteristics, such as eye-colour, which are less subject to change. Traits are typically, but not necessarily, independent of the volition or action of the holder.\"\r\nand\r\n\"This element can be used to extend the range of descriptive information available in the same way as the trait element, using the same content model. However, if there is any confusion over whether something is a state or a trait, then the more general purpose state element should be used as almost all traits are time-bound in a general sense. state may be used for both time-bound and generally unchanging characteristics, but if you wish to distinguish between these then trait is available for the more static of these. Traits are typically, but not necessarily, independent of the volition or action of the holder.\"\r\n\r\nFirst, I think that those two passages are quite redundant and one could be deleted when there is an appropriate reference to the other passage.\r\nSecond, I am confused by the second paragraph's wording \"...as almost all traits are time-bound...\".

Given that these schemes are defined in such a way that they take the existing XPointer schemes as arguments, I see no increase in simplicity here, quite on the contrary. A scheme that presupposes other schemes as arguments may not be simpler than those individual schemes. Additionally, it involves evaluation of XPointer schemes in contexts where \\*no\\* W3C specification expects them \\(= as arguments to other schemes\\). No simplicity there at all. ",

  "description": "== Summary ==\r\n\r\nThe latex2 stylesheet uses \\PrerenderUnicode but does not check that it exists.\r\n\r\n== Versions ==\r\n\r\nUbuntu 12.04\r\n\r\n$ dpkg-query -W tei-p5-xsl2\r\ntei-p5-xsl2     6.8\r\n\r\n== How to Reproduce ==\r\n\r\nTo reproduce the problem on an Ubuntu system, the package texlive-latex-extra must NOT be installed. On other systems, utf8x.def must be missing.\r\n\r\nAny attempt at having a TeX engine process the TeX code produced by using the latex2 stylesheet should reproduce the problem, but I have included a set of files to illustrate.\r\n\r\n1\\. Download the attached zip file.\r\n\r\n2\\. Unzip.\r\n\r\n3\\. Edit the Makefile so that STYLE points to where your copy of the XSLT 2 version of the LaTeX stylesheet is.\r\n\r\n4\\. Execute \r\n\r\n$ make\r\n\r\n== Expected Results ==\r\n\r\nMake should build without error.\r\n\r\n== Actual Results ==\r\n\r\nMake fails due to xelatex terminating with the following error message: \r\n\r\n\\! Undefined control sequence.\r\n&lt;recently read&gt; \\PrerenderUnicode\r\n\r\nl.11 \\PrerenderUnicode\r\n\\{\u2013\\}\r\n\r\n== Observations ==\r\n\r\nOn Ubuntu 12.04 the problem is fixed by installing texlive-latex-extra. \r\n\r\nThe generated latex file contains the following code:\r\n\r\n\\IfFileExists\\{utf8x.def\\}%\r\n\\{\\usepackage\\[utf8x\\]\\{inputenc\\}\\}%\r\n\\{\\usepackage\\[utf8\\]\\{inputenc\\}\\}\r\n\\PrerenderUnicode\\{\u2013\\}\r\n\r\nBut it seems that \\PrerenderUnicode is defined by utf8x. So calling that function without utf8x being loaded is incorrect. While researching a solution to this problem, I came across the following discussion:\r\n\r\nhttps://groups.google.com/group/comp.text.tex/browse\\_thread/thread/e0b0bec4e0dbf8b5/5487c7b0a170b95f?q=utf8x+group%3acomp.text.tex\\#5487c7b0a170b95f\r\n\r\nOn the basis of the discussion there, it seems that the way to go forward would be to declare stylesheet support only for TeX engines which natively support Unicode properly rather than rely on hacks like inputenc.\r\n\r\nTo test that solution, I've modified a stylesheet to remove all references to inputenc \\(with utf8x or utf8\\) and to ucs. I've then recompiled my dissertation, a document of 276 pages containing text in Classical Chinese, Sanskrit and Pali. I haven't noticed any ill effect.\r\n",

It is a fool's life, as they will find when they get to the end of it, if not before. It is said that Deucalion and Pyrrha created men by throwing stones over their heads behind them:\u2014\r\nInde genus durum sumus, experiensque laborum,\r\nEt documenta damus qua simus origine nati.\r\nOr, as Raleigh rhymes it in his sonorous way,\u2014\r\n\"From thence our kind hard-hearted is, enduring pain and care,\r\nApproving that our bodies of a stony nature are.\"\r\nSo much for a blind obedience to a blundering oracle, throwing the stones over their heads behind them, and not seeing where they fell.\r\n\r\nBut surely the &lt;lg&gt;s here are being quoted? so shouldn't they be inside &lt;quote&gt;&lt;lg&gt; rather than just plain &lt;lg&gt; ?\r\n\r\n",

Often, the Digital Thoreau project\r\nteam is not capable of asserting whether an individual line group is a\r\nquotation, based on available research. More advanced editorial issues\r\n\\-- such as determining the authorship and nature of lines of verse --\r\nwill be hopefully addressed by Thoreau scholars later on. I've\r\nprovided two excerpts below as examples of our current challenges:\r\n\r\nEXCERPT ONE: In \"Visitors\", paragraph 17, Thoreau constructs a parody\r\nof a well known nursery rhyme. In the example below, we're not sure if\r\nit really a quote--since it is his own parody. Is Thoreau quoting\r\nhimself? Is his parody a work which stands apart from \"Walden\", and\r\nthus should have a referenced-like relationship that &lt;quote&gt; implies?\r\nOr is it a parody that Thoreau created solely for inclusion in this\r\nparagraph in Walden?\r\n\r\n\" ... A man sits as many risks as he runs. Finally, there were the\r\nself-styled reformers, the greatest bores of all, who thought that I\r\nwas forever singing,\u2014\r\n\r\nThis is the house that I built;\r\nThis is the man that lives in the house that I built;\r\n\r\nbut they did not know that the third line was,\r\n\r\nThese are the folks that worry the man\r\nThat lives in the house that I built.\r\n\r\nI did not fear the hen-harriers, for I kept no chickens; but I feared\r\nthe men-harriers rather. ...\"\r\n\r\n\r\nEXCERPT TWO: In \"Sounds\" paragraph 13, Thoreau inserts a poem of his\r\nown creation into the second-to-last sentence. Again, I'm not \\(yet\\)\r\nsure if this poem was intended to stand alone, or was created solely\r\nfor the purpose of inclusion in Walden:\r\n\r\n\"... They will slink back to their kennels in disgrace, or perchance\r\nrun wild and strike a league with the wolf and the fox. So is your\r\npastoral life whirled past and away. But the bell rings, and I must\r\nget off the track and let the cars go by;\u2014\r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s the railroad to me?\r\nI never go to see\r\nWhere it ends.\r\nIt fills a few hollows,\r\nAnd makes banks for the swallows,\r\nIt sets the sand a-blowing,\r\nAnd the blackberries a-growing,\r\n\r\nbut I cross it like a cart-path in the woods. I will not have my eyes\r\nput out and my ears spoiled by its smoke and steam and hissing.\"\r\n\r\nthanks,\r\n\r\nJoe Easterly",

This seems a bit redundant, since the definitions are essentially identical.\r\n\r\nperson/@age suggests the following example values:\r\n\r\ninfant, child, teen, adult, and senior\r\n\r\nthen the example which actually uses the attribute has a completely different value, \"mid\":\r\n\r\n&lt;person sex=\"2\" age=\"mid\"&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Female respondent, well-educated, born in Shropshire UK, 12 Jan 1950, of unknown occupation. Speaks French fluently. Socio-Economic\r\nstatus B2.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/person&gt;\r\n\r\nThe datatype for @age in both cases is data.enumerated, which is \"a single XML name\"; this has the side-effect of making it impossible to use integers. I think an attribute called \"age\" which doesn't allow you to put in the actual age as an integer is a bit ridiculous.\r\n\r\nWhat I'd like to suggest is this:\r\n\r\n1\\. We should consider an attribute class for the attributes which are shared by &lt;person&gt; and &lt;personGrp&gt; \\(@age, @sex and @role, although the last is slightly more problematic because there's an @role in att.naming which might overlap\\).\r\n\r\n2\\. We should also consider a datatype for @age which allows enumerated values \\(infant, teen, etc.; teens, twenties, thirties, etc.\\) but also allows an integer value for the actual age of the person. It should probably allow floating-point numbers, actually  -- &lt;person id=\"AdrianMole\" age=\"13.75\"&gt;&lt;/person&gt;.\r\n\r\nNeither of these changes would break backward compatibility as far as I can tell. Although moving an attribute into a class might break some existing ODD files, it would not render any existing TEI documents invalid.\r\n\r\nOne thing I haven't figured out is how to have a datatype that allows both enumerated values and integers or floats.",

However, I've just discovered that some though not all of the children of &lt;gramGrp&gt; are allowed as children of &lt;cit&gt;.

This would make &lt;cit&gt; have a similar content model to &lt;form&gt;.  Note, however, that we recently deprecated use of &lt;gram&gt;, &lt;gen&gt;, etc. as children of &lt;form&gt;, instead recommending that they be children of &lt;gramGrp&gt;.  See prose in section 9.3.1. \\(\\#DITPFO\\).\r\n\r\nb\\) &lt;gen&gt; and &lt;pos&gt; would be removed from &lt;cit&gt; so that users would need to nest these elements inside &lt;gramGrp&gt; in order to use them inside of &lt;cit&gt;.  The &lt;cit&gt; element would then become like &lt;entry&gt; and &lt;sense&gt;.\r\n\r\nI recommend \\(b\\) since it corresponds to the deprecation decision.

One might argue that someone using nym should have a gramGrp wrapper, just as we are deciding for cit and have decided for form \\( http://purl.org/tei/bug/3376456 \\).  An alternative would be to do to nym what we're doing to entryFree and dictScrap.  This would leave the content model of nym element unchanged \\(but expressed differently in the ODD\\) and let us move forward on removing elements from model.entryPart.  Laurent suggests creating a new ticket to decide which way to go with nym.\r\n\r\nDoes this sound right?  If so, I'll create that ticket and postpone this one until that one is resolved.",

But there is no &lt;stanza&gt; element. In the guidelines, \"stanza\" is generally a @type of &lt;lg&gt; but is at least once a @type of &lt;div&gt;. \r\n\r\nThe Guidelines say that over two-thirds of the 500+ elements defined in 5.0 are in one of these \"groupings.\" Are those \"groupings\" these \"basic model classes\"? But the opening sentence set the expectation that all elements do. Once the reader sees that they do not, then the relationship between the \"basic model classes\" of 1.3.2.1 and \"model classes\" of 1.3.2 becomes unclear, since the \"basic model classes\" have no unambiguous definition.\r\n",

There isn't a &lt;paragraph&gt; or a &lt;verse line&gt; element either. It's true that a stanza may be represented by a &lt;div type=\"stanza\"&gt; but  a paragraph represented by a &lt;div type=\"para\"&gt; is not inconceivable.\r\n\\- \"groupings\" in the penultimate para of this section is definitely wrong.

For the record, this is given as the &lt;gloss&gt; of the value type=\"colloc\" in the element spec for &lt;usg&gt;.  I didn't include it in the my quotation above and hadn't considered it in my ticket.\r\n\r\nI understand \"collocation\" to mean a set phrase that often occurs, whereas a \"collocate\" is a word that often appears with another in a collocation.  But I've been out of linguistics for a while, but it sounds like this correspond to what Piotr writes below.  I was using \"lexeme\" loosely to mean the sort of thing that has a definition in a dictionary, as opposed to the definition itself.  That is, I meant that &lt;usg&gt; is for explanations, not for forms \\(which would go in &lt;form&gt;\\).\r\n\r\nSo my complaint is that &lt;usg type=\"colloc\"&gt; seems to be meant for an explanation relating to a collocation or collocate \\(not sure which ... perhaps for either\\) but does not contain a collocation or collocate itself, except as mentioned in passing.\r\n\r\nFor parallel structure with the explanation of other values of @type, I suggest revising to:\r\n\r\ntypical collocate of the headword\r\n\r\nTo be even more explicit, it could instead say:\r\n\r\ndescribes a typical collocate of the headword",

When @render is pointing at a &lt;rendition&gt;, it seems like the latter:\r\n\r\n\"@render \tspecifies the identifier of a rendition element which defines how this element is to be rendered.\"\r\n\r\nBut when @rendition points to a &lt;rendition&gt;, it's the former:\r\n\r\n\"@rendition\tpoints to a description of the rendering or presentation used for this element in the source text.\"\r\n\r\nAnd we have reinforced this with a note:\r\n\r\n\"The rendition attribute is used in a very similar way to the class attribute defined for XHTML but with the important distinction that its function is to describe the appearance of the source text, not necessarily to determine how that text should be presented on screen or paper.\"\r\n\r\nIt's not unreasonable to say that &lt;rendition&gt; itself is neutral with regard to its usage -- if it's pointed to by @render, it's meant for output instructions, but if it's pointed to by @rendition it contains a description of the original source -- but if so, I think we should be more explicit about that in the definition of &lt;rendition&gt;, which currently has this:\r\n\r\n\"The present release of these Guidelines does not specify the content of this element in any further detail. It may be used to hold a description of the default rendition to be associated with the specified element, expressed in running prose, or in some more formal language such as CSS.\"\r\n\r\nIdeally, though, we should separate elements and attributes describing the original appearance of the text completely from those which contain rendering instructions for a processor, shouldn't we? This is assuming they're different, of course; in my own projects I use &lt;rendition&gt; \\(and abuse &lt;rend&gt;\\) to describe the original appearance of the text, but then use the CSS directly in the output to render it as well.",

These are too big to be uncompressed and loaded by an ereader \\(Sony PRS-T1\\). It took more than 8 minutes \\(more than 500 secs\\)\r\nto load the first part \\(it isn't only too slow, it empties the battery\\).\r\n\r\nI thought this was caused \\(that the html files containing text weren't 100KB or less\\) by the fact that the text is encoded with the following main divisions: part, section and subsection. But encoding sections as chapters and subsections as sections made no difference.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion to this issue is: wouldn't it be possible that the ePub generation process splits chapters \\(or sections when there are no chapters\\) in different html files? These will be smaller and faster to be loaded in ereaders.\r\n\r\nMany thanks for your help,\r\n\r\n\r\nPablo",

Introducing &lt;equiv/&gt; would touch maybe more then wanted, e.g., in my example I also used &lt;equiv/&gt; to express the data category equivalence for the singular symbol. As FSR and FSD share &lt;symbol/&gt; &lt;equiv/&gt; would also become part of the FSR. The same is true the other way around @dcr:\\* is available for &lt;symbol/&gt; in the FSR so also in the FSD. In my view it would be strange to use &lt;equiv/&gt; in one part of the FSD and @dcr:\\* in another part ...\r\n\r\nJust my 2 cents ...",

It's now proposed to make this explicit by using @dcr:targetDatcat and @dcr:targetValueDatcat. I've added support for this to the DC Reference schema. See DC Reference schema version 1.2 at (on the ISOcat test server, not yet on isocat.org):\r\n\r\n\thttp://lux13.mpi.nl/isocat/12620/\r\n\r\nSo these could be used by fDecl now, e.g.,\r\n\r\n<tei:fDecl name=\"partOfSpeech\" dcr:targetDatcat=\"http://www.isocat.org/datcat/DC-1345\">\r\n\t<tei:vRange>\r\n\t\t<tei:vAlt>\r\n\t\t\t<tei:symbol value=\"...\"/>\r\n\t\t\t<tei:symbol value=\"commonNoun\" dcr:targetValueDatcat=\"http://www.isocat.org/datcat/DC-1256\"/>\r\n\t\t</tei:vAlt>\r\n\t</tei:vRange>\r\n</tei:fDecl>\r\n\r\nDo notice that as the tei:fDecl schema reuses tei:vRange the value declarations, e.f., tei:symbol in this case, should support both the dcr:target* attributes and the 'old' dcr:* attributes as these elements can also appear in an instance.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if I misunderstood or other solutions are preferred. If it's all correct I'll include this in the next update of isocat.org. And also update the FSD support of RELISH LMF (see http://tla.mpi.nl/relish/lmf/). \r\n\r\n[/quote]",

Reviewing the discussion, Piotr's original objection to my hasty solution of adding `<fsd>` to the att.datcat class seems correct. The preferred solution should be to add dcr:targetDatCat to `<fsd>` \r\n\r\nWe could do any of the following:\r\n\r\n(a) Nothing. Adding attributes from another namespace is always possible and does not perturb the schema. If we choose this option however, we really must make the possibility explicit in the text of the Guidelines, and supply an example.\r\n\r\n(b) Modify the att.datcat class soi that it also provides dcr:targetDatCat, possibly adding schematron rules to say that you can only inherit it if you are an `<fsd>` in which case you cannot inherit the other att.datcat attributes. This seems a bit tortuous.\r\n\r\n(c) Explicitly add the attribute to `<fsd>`\r\n\r\n(d) Define a new class att.refDatCat to supply the attribute and add `<fsd>` to it.\r\n\r\nIf it's not obvious I would recommend either (a) or (c).\r\n\r\n\r\n  ",

I could see how you might legitimately use it to link a quotation to the corresponding part of an online instance of the work being quoted, or to a translation of that quotation. The association between a quote and a bibliographic reference for the work quoted seems quite different though: for one thing its not \"mutual\" in the same way . I think I would now recommend instead something close to Syd's first suggestion in this thread -- add a new attribute to link a quote with a citation. This could be called @citRef or just plain @ref and would have precisely the semantics wanted : this points to a bibliographic description for the source of this quotation . \r\n\r\nI am less convinced that there's any need for the other case Syd describes \\(a quote with a ref when the two are not consecutive in the text\\) : the &lt;cit&gt; element is meant for that specific combination iff it appears as such in  a source document. If the two are not consecutive or grouped explicitly in the source, then imho that's not a &lt;cit&gt;. I could probably be bullied into saying you might represent the association using a &lt;join result=\"join\"/&gt; or some such madness, but I don't think it's helpful.",

This is a clear parallel, and if it's wrong, we'll really have to change that too.\r\n\r\nSo I think, on balance, there's a strong case that this is a justified use of @corresp.\r\n\r\nHowever, if it's not, I like your idea of @citRef or @ref. I'd prefer to use the existing @ref, I think, for simplicity, and because it sort of parallels the use of the &lt;ref&gt; element in a &lt;cit&gt;/&lt;quote&gt;/&lt;ref&gt; block. We could add &lt;quote&gt; \\(and &lt;q&gt;???\\) to att.canonical, and perhaps then remove @key from it.\r\n\r\nI'm absolutely convinced of the need for a way to link a quote to a &lt;bibl&gt; which is not contiguous to it; in digital journal encoding, it's something I've wanted for a long time.\r\n\r\n",

However, I found the following example\r\n\r\n&lt;schemaSpec prefix=\"TEI\\_\" ident=\"testsvg\" start=\"TEI svg\"&gt;\r\n&lt;moduleRef key=\"header\"/&gt;\r\n&lt;moduleRef key=\"core\"/&gt;\r\n&lt;moduleRef key=\"tei\"/&gt;\r\n&lt;moduleRef key=\"textstructure\"/&gt;\r\n&lt;moduleRef url=\"svg11.rng\"/&gt;\r\n&lt;/schemaSpec&gt;\r\n\r\nFrom the TEI P5 documentation at:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/TD.html\\#ST-aliens\r\n\r\nSo it seems the intent was to have the schemaSpec element be able to specify any random element known to the ODD instance. In the example above, the svg element.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, if prefixes are needed to prevent a name clash between TEI and non-TEI elements, the ODD markup is incapable of specifying a non-TEI starting element.\r\n\r\nThe following discussion makes use of the examples attached to this bug report. To follow, please:\r\n\r\n1\\. Download the attached zip file.\r\n\r\n2\\. Unzip.\r\n\r\n3\\. Execute \r\n\r\n$ make\r\n\r\nRoma will be executed twice. The first run will finish without error. The second run will generate an error. This is the output when I run it:\r\n\r\n$ make\r\nroma test.xml\r\n========= Roma starts at 2012-10-23 13:47:07 ===========\r\nTEI stylesheet tree: /usr/share/xml/tei/stylesheet\r\nResults to: RomaResults\r\nProcess test.xml to create testsvg1\\{.dtd|.xsd|.doc.xml|.rng|.rnc\\} in RomaResults\r\n========= Roma version 4.9 starts execution at 2012-10-23 13:47:10.811061167 ===========\r\n1\\. expand and simplify ODD\r\n2\\. make RELAX NG from compiled ODD\r\n3\\. make RELAX NG compact from XML\r\n4\\. make XSD from RELAX NG\r\n5\\. make DTD from compiled ODD\r\n========= 2012-10-23 13:49:00.550826608 Roma ends\r\nroma --schema=testsvg2 test.xml\r\n========= Roma starts at 2012-10-23 13:49:00 ===========\r\nTEI stylesheet tree: /usr/share/xml/tei/stylesheet\r\nResults to: RomaResults\r\nProcess test.xml to create testsvg2\\{.dtd|.xsd|.doc.xml|.rng|.rnc\\} in RomaResults\r\n========= Roma version 4.9 starts execution at 2012-10-23 13:49:00.703435150 ===========\r\n1\\. expand and simplify ODD\r\n2\\. make RELAX NG from compiled ODD\r\n3\\. make RELAX NG compact from XML\r\n4\\. make XSD from RELAX NG\r\n/home/ldd/src/teibugs/teibug18/RomaResults/testsvg2.rng:8114:23: error: multiple definitions of \"desc\" without \"combine\" attribute\r\n/home/ldd/src/teibugs/teibug18/RomaResults/testsvg2.rng:9124:24: error: multiple definitions of \"title\" without \"combine\" attribute\r\n/home/ldd/src/teibugs/teibug18/RomaResults/testsvg2.rng:10678:23: error: multiple definitions of \"text\" without \"combine\" attribute\r\n\r\n\r\nERROR:  trang fails.\r\nThis was a fatal error. 2012-10-23 13:49:16\r\n5\\. make DTD from compiled ODD\r\n========= 2012-10-23 13:49:21.652552818 Roma ends\r\n\r\nThe test.xml file contains two schemaSpec elements: testsvg1 and testsvg2. The first one replicates the example from the TEI P5 documentation, with the necessary changes to make it actually run without errors. The following line specifies that the schema should be allowed to start with TEI or with svg:\r\n\r\n&lt;schemaSpec prefix=\"TEI\\_\" ident=\"testsvg1\" start=\"TEI svg\"&gt;\r\n\r\nHowever the testsvg1.rng and rnc files specify that only TEI may start the document:\r\n\r\n&lt;start&gt;\r\n&lt;choice&gt;\r\n&lt;ref name=\"TEI\\_TEI\"/&gt;\r\n&lt;/choice&gt;\r\n&lt;/start&gt;\r\n\r\nI believe this is because the \"TEI\\_\" prefix is used as follows:\r\n\r\n1\\. It is added to all TEI elements and ONLY TEI elements.\r\n\r\n2\\. It is added to both names in the start attribute.\r\n\r\n3\\. roma tries to resolve TEI\\_TEI, finds a corresponding declaration. No problem. It is one possible start.\r\n\r\n4\\. roma tries to resolve TEI\\_svg, finds no corresponding declaration \\(because of point 1 above\\), silently removes TEI\\_svg from possible starts.\r\n\r\n5\\. roma produces the rng fragment shown above.\r\n\r\nThe second run of roma operates with the following declaration:\r\n\r\n&lt;schemaSpec ident=\"testsvg2\" start=\"TEI svg\"&gt;\r\n\r\nThis generates the proper start because there is no prefix and so all the names in the start attribute resolve without problem:\r\n\r\n&lt;start&gt;\r\n&lt;choice&gt;\r\n&lt;ref name=\"TEI\"/&gt;\r\n&lt;ref name=\"svg\"/&gt;\r\n&lt;/choice&gt;\r\n&lt;/start&gt;\r\n\r\nHowever, it also generates errors because of name clashes between TEI and svg. In effect, the rng and rnc files are invalid.\r\n",

There is a way to have the start attribute refer to a non-TEI element, as follows:\r\n\r\n&lt;schemaSpec ident=\"testsvg3\" start=\"TEI svg\\_svg\"&gt;\r\n\\[...\\]\r\n&lt;moduleRef prefix=\"svg\\_\" url=\"../svg11.rng\"/&gt;\r\n&lt;/schemaSpec&gt;\r\n\r\nBasically by adding the prefix attribute to the import and then referrencing the desired element explicitly. I'm going to add an addendum zip file that contains a working example. Run make and it will create schemas that allow TEI and svg as start elements.\r\n\r\nSo the problem is not quite what I thought. However, the TEI documentation is definitely sending users down the wrong path. And I'd say that the solution above is on the obscure side of things.\r\n\r\nSebastian, rather than perhaps update the bug report myself to reflect what I just found, I'll let you decide which direction this bug report should go and make whatever changes you see fit.",

  "description": "== Summary ==\r\n\r\nAs of version 6.15 of tei-p5-xsl2, roma no longer handles attribute definitions in custom odd files.\r\n\r\n== Versions ==\r\n\r\nUbuntu 12.04.1\r\n\r\n$ dpkg-query -W tei-p5-xsl2\r\ntei-p5-xsl2     6.17\r\n\r\n== How to Reproduce ==\r\n\r\nIn the following test1.xml and test2.xml are parallel cases illustrating the same problem. I created test1.xml by hand. However, I considered the possibility tha I was doing something wrong \\(which tei-p5-xsl2 6.14 and earlier let me get away with but was fixed in 6.15 and later\\). So I used http://www.tei-c.org/Roma/ to create a customization. This is test2.xml. Both show the same problem regarding attributes.\r\n\r\n1\\. Download the attached zip file.\r\n\r\n2\\. Unzip, cd into new directory.\r\n\r\n3\\. Execute:\r\n\r\n$ roma test1.xml out1\r\n$ roma test2.xml out1\r\n\r\n\r\n4\\. Adapt the following command to your platform; as is, it definitely works on Ubuntu systems and should work on any Debian-derived system. It downgrades tei-p5-xsl2 to version 6.14:\r\n\r\n$ sudo apt-get install tei-p5-xsl2=6.14\r\n\r\n5\\. Execute:\r\n\r\n$ roma test1.xml out2\r\n$ roma test2.xml out2\r\n\r\n6\\. Compare how the element unique is declared in out1/test1.rnc and out2/test1.rnc. The relevant portion of a diff is as follows:\r\n\r\n4103c4388,4394\r\n&lt;   element ns2:unique \\{ \\div+ \\}\r\n\\---\r\n&gt;   element ns2:unique \\{\r\n&gt;     \\div+,\r\n&gt;     \r\n&gt;     \\#\\# Test.\r\n&gt;     attribute authority \\{ text \\},\r\n&gt;     empty\r\n&gt;   \\}\r\n\r\nYou'd see something similar if diffing out1/test2.rnc and out2/test2.rnc.\r\n\r\nTo upgrade again to the latest version \\(as above, adapt to your platform\\):\r\n\r\n$ sudo apt-get install tei-p5-xsl2\r\n\r\n== Expected Results ==\r\n\r\nThe definition of the element unique should in both cases include the foo attribute.\r\n\r\n== Actual Results ==\r\n\r\nIf run with version 6.17 of tei-p5-xsl2 \\(or 6.15 for that matter\\) the foo attribute is missing.\r\n",

It's easy enough to think of lists whose items aren't marked by letters, numbers, or anything else but are still ordered.

To me, @rend should more precisely describe rendering in a source document than simply \"ordered\" (or \"sequential\").  Even though we are trying to differentiate between @type and @rend, giving something like \"ordered\" as a sample value continues to blur the distinction because, in my mind at least, there is a strong semantic difference between an ordered and unordered list.  If I were composing a document in TEI, in many cases I would happily use @type='ordered' and @type='unordered' to control whether the list should be rendered with some sort of numbering/letter or some sort of bullets.  Therefore, I suggest giving the following sample values for @type:\r\n\r\nordered\r\nunordered\r\ngloss\r\ningredients\r\nsyllogism\r\n\r\nThat will get people started down the path of imagining their own typology of lists.",

The prescription I see in the paragraph \"By contrast, bibl . . . punctuate the data\" is that &lt;bibl&gt; should include punctuation, \n\nMaybe someone prefers to use &lt;bibl&gt; to encode database fields, because biblStruct and biblFull are too constraining. I can see the argument for that \\(though the Guidelines don't condone it\\). But then note the encoding decision, be consistent, and drop the punctuation completely. \n\nThere is just nothing a non-human consumer can do with that example. And a human consumer would need to consider each element, one by one, and try to divine what was intended and what to do with what is there.\n\n&gt;perhaps enforcing their own structure through customizations &lt;\n\nUnless otherwise noted, examples in the Guidelines assume uncustomized TEI, right?",

So putting white space to separate the linking elements produced for the multiple values of @target makes sense.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, it very rarely the case that in actual usage pointers separated by spaces would work for me. I'd almost always want something else. Most often, I think I'd want &lt;ptr target=\"\\#P1 \\#P2 ... \\#Pn\"&gt; to be equivalent to:\r\n\r\n&lt;ptr target=\"\\#P1\"&gt;, &lt;ptr target=\"\\#P2\"&gt;, &lt;ptr target=\"\\#P3\"&gt;, ..., &lt;ptr target=\"\\#Pn-1\"&gt; and &lt;ptr target=\"\\#Pn\"&gt;\r\n\r\nOf course this is language-dependent. However, if the stylesheets default to separating the elements by white spaces, then I'd \\*always\\* have to customize how links are produced to get what I want.\r\n\r\nThere are perhaps very good reasons trying to implement what I'd like would require changes to the stylesheets that are too ambitious at this stage of the evolution of TEI, or is undesirable for another reason. If so, then I would still like the solution to provide for a least intrusive way to override the default behavior. Maybe a template, designed with the intent of it being readily overridable, which would produce a separator upon being called with the index number of the @target value that will be output next and the total number of values would allow for a \"least intrusive way\" to do what I'd like?\r\n",

        "text": "  My first instinct is that there is absolutely no need to constrain\r\nthe order of publication place, address, identifier, availability, and\r\ndate, but it is very important to associate those details with the\r\npublisher, distributor, or authority concerned. In the current model,\r\nthis is done by having the publication place, address, identifier,\r\navailability, or date immediately follow the publisher, distributor,\r\nor authority to which it applies.\r\n  Personally I don't like this. I prefer containment. Thus I have\r\nsuggested before, and will suggest again, that &lt;publisher>,\r\n&lt;distributor>, and &lt;authority> should *contain* the publication place,\r\naddress, identifier, availability, or date elements that apply to\r\nthem. I.e., instead of macro.phraseSeq, their content model would be\r\nsomething like ( model.nameLike.agent, model.newclass* ), where the\r\nnew class has &lt;pubPlace>, &lt;idno>, &lt;availability>, &lt;address>, and &lt;date> is its members.\r\n  Thus we'd see things like\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\n    <distributor>\r\n      <orgName>Brown University Women Writers Project</orgName>\r\n      <availability>\r\n        <license>CC3 blah blah</license>\r\n      <availability>\r\n      <date when=\"2013-04-10\"/>\r\n    </distributor>\r\n~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\nNote that this completely breaks the model that\r\n&lt;distributor>...&lt;/distributor> is syntactic sugar for\r\n~~~~~~\r\n<respStmt><resp>distribution</resp><name>...</name></respStmt>, \r\n~~~~~~\r\nwhich\r\nsome subscribe to. It also breaks existing P5 documents.\r\n  So, unless Council thinks this is important enough to break existing\r\ndocuments, we need to come up with a backwards-compatible solution.\r\nSebastian's analysis that a specific content model would break what we\r\ntry to with classes is correct. Doesn't bother me much. That said,\r\nsince I don't think the order of the detail elements (&lt;pubPlace>,\r\n&lt;idno>, &lt;availability>, &lt;address>, and &lt;date>) is important, I'd be \r\nhappy with\r\n  ( ( ( model.A, model.B* )+, model.pLike* ) | model.pLike+ )\r\nwhere \r\n  model.A = ( publisher | distributor | authority )\r\n  model.B = ( pubPlace | idno | availability | address | date )\r\nThis enforces the important part, does not enforce the unimportant\r\npart (which should be removed from the prose, too, of course), and\r\nleverages the class system (i.e., does not directly mention elements\r\nin content model). And I'm pretty sure it's deterministic, so won't\r\nbreak DTDs.\r\n\r\n",

Maybe there should be such an element, but there isn't at present and that's not what the ticket proposes. Instead, and as agreed at the Council meeting, the action should be (a) to clarify in the prose that the sequencing requirement applies only in the case where the element contains elements other than `<p>` and (b) to check practice in the Guidelines for conformity with this requirement.  \r\n\r\nHere's the rewording I have just made:\r\n\r\n<p>Where a publication statement contains several members of\r\n    the mode.publicationStmtPart class rather than one or more\r\n    paragraphs, care should be taken to ensure that the repeated\r\n    elements are presented in a meaningful order.

Some of the prose of the GLs has been updated to match, but there is still tidying up to do in the prose. E.g., the prose still asserts that \ufe64pubPlace\ufe65, \ufe64address\ufe65,\ufe64idno\ufe65,\ufe64avail\ufe65, and \ufe64date\ufe65, must be specified in that order, which the schema does not support. (And personally I see no reason to keep this order, but perhaps someone else knows why it was enforced that way in the first place -- it has been like that since P2.)\r\n\r\nStill leaving the ticket open pending some tweaks to the prose of section 2.2.4. Some notes:\r\n\r\n* The new content model is slightly different than the one proposed 2013-04-10: that one permitted paragraphs to occur after all of the specialized elements. The new model just introduced  continues to enforce the \u201ceither all prose or all specialized\u201d division that was enforced in P2, P3, P4, and heretofore in P5. I think this is a bad rule, and will try again to get rid of it in the future.\r\n* Besides not enforcing the order of \ufe64pubPlace\ufe65, \ufe64address\ufe65,\ufe64idno\ufe65,\ufe64avail\ufe65, and \ufe64date\ufe65 this new content model also does not enforce the number of them. In P2 you were permitted only 0 or 1 each of \ufe64pubPlace\ufe65, \ufe64address\ufe65, \ufe64avail\ufe65, and \ufe64date\ufe65 after a \ufe64publisher\ufe65, \ufe64distributor\ufe65, \ufe64authority\ufe65, but as many \ufe64idno\ufe65s as you wanted. This constraint was not carried forward for three reasons:\r\n    1. First and foremost, AFAIK this restriction was not carried forward into P3. It wasn't reinstated in P4, either, although that does not mean much as P4 dropped many constraints from the DTD that either were not dropped from the prose or (IMHO) should not have been dropped.\r\n    2. Second, the ODD language has no way to express this without dropping down to explicit RELAX NG code, something Council has been trying to avoid.\r\n    3. And third, although the P2 DTD had this restriction, the prose did not mention it.\r\n",

The file cannot be opened.\r\n\r\ntest2.docx opens normally.\r\n\r\n== Observations ==\r\n\r\nI'm no Office OpenXML expert so take the following with a whole cup of salt.\r\n\r\nAdapt the following to your OS and editor or validator of choice:\r\n\r\n$ mkdir t\r\n$ cd t\r\n$ unzip ../test1.docx\r\n$ cd word/\r\n\r\n\\# The next command merely improves readability.\r\n$ xmllint --format document.xml &gt; document.fmt.xml\r\n\r\n$ emacsclient document.fmt.xml \r\n\r\nM-x nxml-mode if needed, and set the schema to point to Office OpenXML's appropriate rnc.\r\n\r\nThere will be two groups of errors reported by nxml mode:\r\n\r\n\\- The presence of @w:type on w:gridCol elements multiple times, which happens to be harmless right now. \\(Yet, looking at ISO/IEC 29500-1:2012\\(E\\) section 17.4.16, I do not see w:gridCol accepting @w:type.\\)\r\n\r\n\\- The presence of a &lt;w:r&gt; element in the wrong place \\(on line 52\\). This is is what causes Word to bail. It occurs only once in test1.docx.\r\n\r\nUpon replacing document.xml with a version which does not have the offending &lt;w:r&gt;, Word can open the document. As noted above, the errant occurrences of @w:type do not seem to cause any ill effect.\r\n\r\nFor what it is worth, both files crash libreoffice. I do not know why but I'm tempted to think the problem is libreoffice, because I've removed all errors reported by nxml-mode and still libreoffice crashes. Here's the version used:\r\n\r\n$ dpkg-query -W libreoffice-common\r\nlibreoffice-common      1:3.6.2~rc2-0ubuntu3\r\n\r\n",

As of the version mentioned in the bug report, the template contains a choice branch &lt;xsl:when test=\"count\\(\\*\\)=1 and tei:note\"&gt;. It is when this branch is taken that teitodocx generates an unopenable docx.

Following the decision of Council at the FTF in Oxford in September 2012, the original ticket is to be closed and a clean new ticket opened to discuss the deprecation of data.key.\r\n\r\nThe option of using and documenting private URI schemes is now implemented in the Guidelines and will be in the first release in 2013, so we are one step closer to being able to plan a deprecation strategy for magic-token attributes. data.key itself is now gone, and attributes which used to have that datatype \\(such as @lemma, @key\\) have now been redefined as having data.text \\(rev 10512, http://purl.org/tei/bugs/3531765\\). So:\r\n\r\n\\- Should we deprecate the use of @key \\(as defined in att.canonical, distinct from its definitions in memberOf etc.\\)?\r\n\r\n\\- What exactly should we encourage instead, in the various contexts in which @key is used and exemplified? \\(There are several dozen examples which use att.canonical's @key, all of which would need to be replaced.\\)\r\n\r\n\\- Should @lemma also be up for consideration? \\(Probably not.

Download the attached zip file.\r\n\r\n2\\. Unzip. Cd into new directory.\r\n\r\n3\\. Adapt the Makefile so that APPHOME points to your svn tree.\r\n\r\n4\\. Execute:\r\n\r\n$ make\r\n\r\nThis will produce test\\{1,2\\}.html file from test\\{1,2\\}.xml, and test\\{1,2\\}-fmt.html which are the same as the corresponding html but with xmllint --format applied to help diagnosis.\r\n\r\nThe test1.xml contains the following relevant features. Its first paragraph contains a reference to TARGET1, which is a later paragraph. Its second paragraph contains a reference to TARGET2 which is a &lt;ref&gt; element which in turns point to TARGET1.\r\n\r\nThe only difference between test1.xml and test2.xml is that the target of the reference which has an xml:id is a file instead of an internal target.\r\n\r\n$ diff test1.xml test2.xml\r\n52c52\r\n&lt;       &lt;p&gt;And a &lt;ref xml:id=\"TARGET2\" target=\"\\#TARGET1\"&gt;target which is also a reference&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\\---\r\n&gt;       &lt;p&gt;And a &lt;ref xml:id=\"TARGET2\" target=\"/blah/blah\"&gt;target which is also a reference&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n== Expected Results ==\r\n\r\nWorking links in the HTML produced from test2.xml. \\(Just like in the HTML produced from test1.xml\\).\r\n\r\n== Actual Results ==\r\n\r\nThe links in the HTML produced from test1.xml work fine.\r\n\r\nHowever, link with an xml:id in test2.xml is not converted correctly. The only difference from what is produced from test1.xml should be that its target is a file, but it also loses its @id:\r\n\r\n$ diff test1-fmt.html test2-fmt.html \r\n55c55\r\n&lt;       &lt;p&gt;And a &lt;a id=\"TARGET2\" href=\"\\#TARGET1\" class=\"link\\_ref\"&gt;target which is also a reference&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\\---\r\n&gt;       &lt;p&gt;And a &lt;a class=\"link\\_ref\" href=\"/blah/blah\"&gt;target which is also a reference&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n63c63\r\n&lt;         on 2012-12-06T11:11:05Z--&gt;&lt;/address&gt;\r\n\\---\r\n&gt;         on 2012-12-06T11:11:09Z--&gt;&lt;/address&gt;\r\n\r\n== Observations ==\r\n\r\nThis a special case of bug ID 3590105.\r\n",

Download the attached zip file.\r\n\r\n2\\. Unzip. Cd into new directory.\r\n\r\n3\\. Adapt the Makefile to change the values of APPHOME to those appropriate to your system. See the comments in the Makefile.\r\n\r\n4\\. Execute:\r\n\r\n$ make\r\n\r\nThis will produce test1.docx from test1.xml. The files will be in \"shared\" subdirectory. These files will be built from whatever TEI version is installed on the system. The makefile will also unzip the resulting docx file into test1-unzipped.docx and it will format the word/document.xml file and save it in word/document-fmt.xml. \r\n\r\n\\(The Makefile also supports building with SVN=1 to build from a svn checkout but that is not critical in this case.\\)\r\n\r\n== Actual Results ==\r\n\r\n/TEI/text/front/div\\[@type=\"abstract\"\\]/p will have a Word style of \"Abstract\" which does not actually exist.\r\n\r\n/TEI/text/front/div\\[@type=\"Platypus\"\\]/p will have a Word style of \"Platypus\" which does not actually exist.\r\n\r\n/TEI/text/front/div\\[@type=\"\u0101-ga-ma\"\\]/p will have a Word style of \"\u0100-ga-ma\" which does not actually exist.\r\n\r\n/TEI/text/body/div\\[@type=\"abstract\"\\]/p will have the Normal style.\r\n\r\nThis can be verified by inspecting the document-fmt.xml file produce from running make.\r\n\r\n== Expected Results ==\r\n\r\nI would not expect that @type be used to set styles on the Word side. @rend maybe. @type might have an \\*effect\\* on which styles are applied but not be transformed into a style name \\*directly.\\*\r\n\r\nI would also not expect that merely moving a paragraph from front to body, or vice-versa, would change its Word style.\r\n",

  "summary": "Re-open @xml:space - ID: 3554294",
  "description": "The explanations added for @xml:space still need work. I'm afraid the author was laboring under misunderstandings about @xml:space comparable to the ones I had on my first of many forays into the whitespace forest. \r\n\r\nThe three bulleted points are untrue. And the advice about using \"preserve\" in transcriptions, if taken literally, is sure to mislead.\r\n\r\nSome clarifications, reminders, principles:\r\n\r\n\\- XML defines only \"preserve\" and \"default\" for @xml:space. It does not have, for example, xsd's \"collapse\" or \"replace.\"\r\n\\- \"preserve\", \"collapse\", \"normalize\", and \"trim\" are different.\r\n\\- XML does not define \"default\". If an XML processor's handling of \"default\" is predictable it is for some other reason -- convention, quirks everyone knows about, programming culture, standard settings, some other spec, whatever.\r\n\\- There is no such thing as a whitespace character. There are whitespace characters \\(plural\\).\r\n\r\n\r\nBullet 1:\r\n\r\nYes, the behavior of XML processors is generally predictable, but the expected behavior is not to PRESERVE but to COLLAPSE whitespace. In text nodes, XML considers whitespace significant, but not white space characters. So processors will generally COLLAPSE \"carriage return - tab - space - space - space\" and treat that string as if it had been one space character. To PRESERVE that sequence means to retain all five characters as is. \\(REPLACE is to convert it into five space characters.\\)\r\n\r\nBullet 2:\r\n\r\nPRESERVE and COLLAPSE are also different from TRIM and NORMALIZE. Whether the processor will trim -- an that's the crucial and tricky piece in mixed-content documents -- is less predictable. A stock XSL transformation will, but one designed for mixed-content documents might not. But again, no processor will by default preserve -- collapse yes, trim probably \\(to frequent disappointment\\) , preserve definitely not. \r\n\r\nBullet 3 and the list example:\r\n\r\nIt is not true that XML generally assumes whitespace between elements is insignificant. By default XSL must preserve whitespace nodes as significant. To reverse this, the programmer must insert &lt;xsl:strip-space elements=\"\\*\"/&gt;. Many, many XSL programmers have never dealt with mixed-content XML and very, very few with a hybrid like TEI, where mixed-content and structured vary element by element. Most XSL programmers are trained to work in corporate IT departments where structured data is all they will ever see. They will insert the global strip-space command because that's what they've always done and forget why or even that it is there.\r\n\r\nSo a lot of XML programming culture assumes whitespace between elements is insignificant, but the programming tools by default assume the exact opposite.\r\n\r\nIt is wrong to say that \"not all processors can detect \\[the significance of inter-element whitespace\\] reliably.\" Processors will treat the whitespace exactly as told. There is no detecting for the processor to do. If &lt;xsl:strip-space&gt; \\(or some other schema-communicating instruction\\) tells them to strip space, they will. Otherwise they won't. Authors of vocabularies are responsible for telling processors which elements are mixed-content and which are structured. \\(Sebastian posted this once, but I don't believe it became a standard part of a release.\\)\r\n\r\nTEI makes such communication difficult, because some elements are mixed-content, some are structured, and -- to make it worse -- some are defined as mixed-content yet treated, even in the Guidelines, as structured. The document will appear conformant but then get corrupted downstream when the consumers assume the element was used as spec'd. \\(An error like this occurred to one TEI user who contacted me after they corrupted a whole batch of TEI files and didn't realize it soon enough and couldn't even figure out what went wrong.\\)\r\n\r\nThe case of transcription:\r\n\r\nThis sounds incorrect and a trap for the unwary. PRESERVE means \"do not REMOVE whitespace characters.\" It says nothing about INSERTING whitespace between elements where no whitespace exists -- and it shouldn't need to. No consumer of an XML file should ever do that. That would add a node to the tree. Bad. Maybe some application does that as part of a suite of tools, but then that application is not an XML editor. It's an XML changer.\r\n\r\nSo there should be no need to add 'preserve' just to stop downsteam apps from inserting whitespace nodes. But also, adding 'preserve' to a DIV tells processors to retain every space character, tab, and carriage return anywhere in that DIV. It's hard to imagine a scenario where that is intended.\r\n\r\nAnyway, anyway -- the attempt to better explain @xml:space, I'm afraid, makes matters worse. Whitespace handling in XML is difficult enough. In TEI it's even more so. The Guidelines need to be super accurate. \r\n\r\nWhoever gets stuck with writing a short bit for that passage really needs to understand, I think, everything it took me so long to figure out and that I put in http://wiki.tei-c.org/index.php/XML\\_Whitespace -- as well as all that is in the external resources linked there, including the discussion about @xml:space on xml-dev, where some really top XML experts got challenged with how to apply xml:space in an architecture like TEI's.\r\n\r\nI don't think the new passage needs just a few tweaks. If the subtleties of @xml:space can trip up someone as experienced as whoever wrote that passage, then general readers need specific, careful, and accurate guidance indeed. I think the passage needs substantive reworking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

        "text": "Here is a draft. I recommend it get its own heading, 1.3.1.1.5 XML Whitespace.\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nThe global attribute @xml:space provides a mechanism for signaling to users of an XML file how whitespace, that is, consecutive tab \\(\\#x09\\), space \\(\\#x20\\), carriage return \\(\\#x0D\\) and/or linefeed \\(\\#x0A\\) characters, should be treated. There are only two allowed values, \u201cpreserve\u201d and \u201cdefault\u201d. The first indicates that whitespace in a text node\u2014every carriage return, every tab, etc.\u2014should be maintained as is. The second, or just exclusion of the attribute, indicates that whitespace should be handled as appropriate. What is deemed appropriate is left unspecified by the XML Recommendation.\n\nThese Guidelines do not specify a default behavior, but examples in the Guidelines generally presume one of two behaviors. For an element that can contain only other elements, a so-called structured element, it is presumed that whitespace has no sematic significance and can and indeed will be removed. For example, in a &lt;choice&gt; element, such as \n&lt;choice&gt;\n&lt;sic&gt;1724&lt;/sic&gt;\n&lt;corr&gt;1728&lt;/corr&gt;\n&lt;/choice&gt;\nno non-whitespace characters are allowed between opening of the &lt;choice&gt; tag and opening of the &lt;sic&gt; tags or between the &lt;sic&gt; and &lt;corr&gt; tags, so any space there has no significance and can treated as if not there at all. A list of such structured elements is included in the TEI release file stripspace.xsl.model, formatted there for use as an &lt;xsl:strip-space&gt; command for XSL stylesheets.\n\nFor an element that can contain both text and other elements, so-called mixed-content elements, examples in the Guidelines presume that whitespace will be normalized. This means that all space, carriage return, linefeed, and tab characters are converted into spaces, all consecutive spaces are then deleted and replaced by one space, and then space immediately after a start tag or immediately before an end tag is deleted. The result is that this encoding,\n&lt;persName&gt;\n&lt;forename&gt;Edward&lt;/forename&gt;\n&lt;forename&gt;George&lt;/forename&gt;\n&lt;surname type=\"linked\"&gt;Bulwer-Lytton&lt;/surname&gt;,\n&lt;roleName&gt;Baron Lytton of\n&lt;placeName&gt;Knebworth&lt;/placeName&gt;\n&lt;/roleName&gt;\n&lt;/persName&gt;\nwill produce \u201cEdward George Bulwer-Lytton, Baron Lytton of Knebworth\u201d. The space before his name has been removed, a space included between his forenames, the comma preserved, the newlines after his name removed, etc. \n\nThe &lt;persName&gt; element is a mixed-content element; punctuation such as the comma in the above example lies outside any of the child elements. The &lt;address&gt; element, on the other hand, is like &lt;list&gt; and &lt;choice&gt;, a structured element. \\(These three are included in stripspace.xsl.model.\\) No punctuation is allowed outside the elements within &lt;address&gt; and the presumed processing behavior is that any space between its components will get removed. An application processing an &lt;address&gt; element is then responsible for adding any necessary space or punctuation between the components of the address. Treating a structured element as a mixed-content one, or vice versa, should be done with care. If it is done, the schema should be customized to record the fact.\n\nPreference for a default whitespace processing other than that described above can be indicated in &lt;encodingDesc&gt;. Preference for strict retention of every space, tab, carriage return and linefeed character in a text node can be signaled with @xml:space=\u201dpreserve\u201d. Had this been done on the &lt;persName&gt; example above, the man\u2019s name would get presented on five lines, indented, and with a blank line following. The @xml:space=\u201dpreserve\u201d attribute is rarely used in TEI documents because whatever could be accomplished by doing so is generally accomplished with less risk and more precision by using native TEI elements such as &lt;l&gt;, &lt;lb&gt;, &lt;space&gt;, and others.\n\n",

Whatever could be accomplished by using it is usually accomplished with less risk and more precision by using native TEI elements such as &lt;l&gt;, &lt;lb&gt;, &lt;space&gt; and others.\r\n\r\nNeither XML nor TEI specify default processing for XML whitespace. Examples in TEI 5 Guidelines, however, presume that such whitespace will be normalized according to conventional rules for normalizing whitespace in mixed-content XML structures. If encoders expect applications to process whitespace otherwise, this should be noted in &lt;encodingStmt&gt;. Unless indicated otherwise by such a statement or by xml:space='preserve', consumers of TEI encodings should normalize XML whitespace.\r\n\r\nFor further background and recommendations, see XML Whitespace in the TEI Wiki \\(http://wiki.tei-c.org/index.php/XML\\_Whitespace\\) and the XML specification \\(http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/\\#sec-white-space\\).\r\n\r\n\\----\r\n\r\nThis change to the reference page may not be necessary if the Guidelines are being changed, though I do still think there is value in a link to the Wiki page, a fuller explication intended more for schema-designers and authors of processing software, the kind of people who would read the reference page and not just the Guidelines. I just don't know if links to the Wiki are acceptable.",

  "summary": "Meaning of @corresp rather in dispute",
  "description": "Recent discussions on Council and TEI-L suggest that there are two distinct views on how @corresp should be used. \r\n\r\nLou's strong view is that @corresp \"really is meant only for cases where the target and the source are interchangeable, as for example where one translates the other. I also think it is meant to be bidirectional  -- that is,  if corresp\\(a.b\\), then corresp\\(b,a\\).\"\r\n\r\nThe other view \\(held by me, and I think also by James\\) is that it's a general-purpose attribute for linking between two things that have virtually any relationship the encoder wishes to capture. The definition of the attribute would seem to support this lax view: \"points to elements that correspond to the current element in some way\".\r\n\r\nI think we definitely need to clarify this, since the lax use of @corresp is widespread. If indeed Lou is right, and @corresp is a specialist attribute, then I think there is a clear and desperate need for a general-purpose global linking attribute -- @link, perhaps. There are many use-cases, but here is one:\r\n\r\nIn a personography representing the characters appearing in a Shakespeare play, an individual character may have different names in different versions. I need to specify, for each &lt;persName&gt; element inside &lt;person&gt;, which versions of the work it is used in. So using @corresp, I would do this:\r\n\r\n&lt;person xml:id=\"Polonius\"&gt;\r\n&lt;persName corresp=\"ver:F1 ver:FM ver:Q2 ver:Q2M ver:EM\"&gt;Polonius&lt;/persName&gt;\r\n&lt;persName corresp=\"ver:Q1 ver:Q1M\"&gt;Corambis&lt;/persName&gt;\r\n&lt;/person&gt;\r\n\r\nOther characters may only appear in some versions of the work, so the same attribute needs to be available on &lt;person&gt;.",

  "description": "== Summary ==\r\n\r\nteitodocx: tei:label treatment loses context\r\n\r\n== Versions ==\r\n\r\nOS: Ubuntu 12.10\r\n\r\nTEI package version:\r\n\r\n$ apt-cache policy tei-p5-xsl2\r\ntei-p5-xsl2:\r\nInstalled: 6.26\r\nCandidate: 6.26\r\nVersion table:\r\n\\*\\*\\* 6.26 0\r\n500 http://tei.oucs.ox.ac.uk/teideb/binary/ ./ Packages\r\n100 /var/lib/dpkg/status\r\n\\[... etc ...\\]\r\n\r\n== How to Reproduce ==\r\n\r\n1\\. Download the attached zip file.\r\n\r\n2\\. Unzip. Cd into new directory.\r\n\r\n3\\. Edit stock.mk so that APPHOME points to whatever stylesheet directory you use when you want to use the \"stock\" TEI files.\r\n\r\n4\\. Execute:\r\n\r\n$ make CONFIG=stock.mk\r\n\r\nThis will produce test1.docx from test1.xml. The output will be in the \"stock\" subdirectory. \r\n\r\n5\\. Execute:\r\n\r\n$ make CONFIG=local.mk\r\n\r\nThe output will be in the \"local\" subdirectory this time. This make uses of the \"stock\" tree but with the patch in stylesheet.diff applied. The modified tree is saved locally in the stylesheet directory.\r\n\r\n== Actual Results ==\r\n\r\nThe \"stock\" subirectory contains what someone would get when running teitodocx without further customization: \r\n\r\nlabel on one line\r\ngloss on the next line.\r\n\r\n== Expected Results ==\r\n\r\nThe \"local\" subdirectory contains what someone would get if the default profile for processing docx did not contain special code for handling tei:label: \r\n\r\nlabel at the beginning of the line, tab, and gloss.\r\n\r\n== Observations ==\r\n\r\n1\\. The difference between the stock TEI tree and the local tree is that two templates dealing with tei:label were removed from stylesheet/profiles/default/docx/to.xsl. Effectively, this means that in the local tree stylesheet/docx/to/lists.xsl handles tei:label.\r\n\r\n2\\. From a purely visual standpoint it is not clear whether the way the stock stylesheet/profiles/default/docx/to.xsl handles tei:label or the way stylesheet/docx/to/lists.xsl does it is better. That is, I think this is dependent on what the person calling teitodocx is trying to do. I see that stylesheet/profiles/default/docx/to.xsl handles long labels better but I happen to be working on a project where I do not have long labels \\(abbreviation lists\\). It so happens that the way stylesheet/docx/to/lists.xsl does it is \\*much\\* better for me, visually, than the way stylesheet/profiles/default/docx/to.xsl does it.\r\n\r\n3\\. The way stylesheet/profiles/default/docx/to.xsl does it actually has a serious drawback from an XSLT standpoint: it completely obliterates context information. Before I figured out that stylesheet/profiles/default/docx/to.xsl was doing some special treatment of tei:label I had some code that would mysteriously fail because it depended on detecting that an element was inside tei:front rather than elsewhere. But stylesheet/profiles/default/docx/to.xsl creates a tree that has tei:list for root and processes it. The processing done by stylesheet/docx/to/lists.xsl does not suffer from this issue because it preserves context information.\r\n\r\n\\(I've asked myself whether this is a feature request or a bug report. Point 3 is the one which makes it go into bug report territory.\\)\r\n\r\n=== Possible solutions ===\r\n\r\n1\\. Change stylesheet/profiles/default/docx/to.xsl so that it does not try to process tei:label. Easy but this would break things for anyone who depended on the way stylesheet/profiles/default/docx/to.xsl does it.\r\n\r\n2\\. Change stylesheet/profiles/default/docx/to.xsl so that it preserves context information. \\(Since there is no way to tell the XSLT processor \"use the tei:label processing from stylesheet/docx/to/lists.xsl instead of stylesheet/profiles/default/docx/to.xsl, I'd still have to do something in my own customization like cut-and-paste things from stylesheet/docx/to/lists.xsl. Yuck\\!\\)\r\n\r\n3\\. Make the choice of single line vs separate lines be a configuration option, with the default being separate lines \\(for compatibility with previous versions\\). Preserve context information no matter what option is selected.\r\n",

Before doing so however, we should decide on whether or not the idea of \"collapsing\" multiple breaks is a good one.\r\n\r\nWhat does &lt;gb/&gt;&lt;pb/&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; mean? a gathering cannot start without ipso facto starting a page, and a page cannot start without ipso facto starting a line, so the presence of &lt;pb/&gt; and &lt;lb/&gt; in the sequence is arguably redundant. However, if the three levels are being explicitly recorded separately via their @n attributes, the tags are also clearly useful. It seems reasonably to say therefore that no \\*additional\\* whitespace should be generated. \r\n\r\nThe interaction with &lt;p&gt; &lt;div&gt; etc seems different, because these things are not so clearly linked directly to line or page starts. Yes, usually a div starts a new page, but not necessarily. &lt;div&gt; and &lt;p&gt;represent structural components, not layout.\r\n",

  "description": "The content model of `<w>` includes a variety of unlikely things, but does not include `<pc>`. While it's true that for many corpus builders punctuation is defined as the stuff between words, and that hence the two tags should be mutually exclusive, there seems very little point in defining the attribute @force on `<pc>` with values such as \"weak : the punctuation mark is not a word separator\" or  \"inter : the punctuation mark may or may not be a word separator\" if you can't actually put the the element inside a `<w>` anyway! In practice hyphenated words exist, and one might want to use `<pc>` to tag the hyphens. I believe this is a simple oversight introduced when this element was added.",

Further, only those in\r\n    <elementSpec> and <attDef> make it from the compiled ODD into the\r\n    .rng file (i.e. the one in <schemaSpec> is dropped); all three\r\n    make it into the .isosch file.\r\n",

This ticket is a consequence of someone failing to understand what is (ipso facto) poorly expressed in the Guidelines, so the way to resolve it is to improve that expression, not to cobble together a ridiculous content model which will come back to bite us every other day. For example: suppose we remove an element from model.phrase: it will still appear here. Suppose we define a new model.phrase element: it will not appear here. Finding out/remembering why this idiosyncratic behaviour occurs is a waste of everyone's time.",

Leave well alone because nothing is broken.\r\n+ Improve the documentation to explain that this element is mainly used in intermediate steps when processing ODD files to produce schemas.\r\n+ Add more detailed documentation with some examples of how you might use this in a user-created ODD file.\r\n+ Extend it to add Lou's requested @element attribute, which would enable one element to pull a copy of an attribute defined locally on another element. There would probably have to be some namespace-related functionality to go along with this, and it would require more work in the Stylesheets code.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I favour #1 or #2. I haven't seen any convincing use-cases for #3 or #4 which cannot be accomplished in other ways. The use-case for #3 might be (for instance) adding @xml:id to a new element you're creating, but that could be achieved by adding it to add.global and then deleting the other global attributes you don't want (admittedly long-winded but familiar); in the case of #4, I think that once you're sharing an attribute between two elements you might as well create a class they can both belong to which defines the attribute, rather than define it on one and refer to it from the other.",

The resulting ODD uses `@mode=\"change\"` rather than @mode=\"add\" on the `<attDef>` for the new attribute, and the resulting schema thus does not actually include the attribute.\r\n\r\nBelow is a test ODD, and here's what I did to generate it:\r\n\r\n1. In Roma, choose \"Build up...\"\r\n2. Clicked on Modules and kept the default set\r\n3. Clicked on the textstructure module in the list of selected modules\r\n4. For the `<div>` element, clicked on its \"change attributes\" link\r\n5. Clicked on \"Add new attributes\" at the top of the screen\r\n6. Named the attribute \"test\", non-optional, no default value, closed list, with a list of values \"one,two,three\" and a brief description.\r\n7. Clicked save on that screen and also the Added Attributes screen\r\n8.

This is to allow the expressing of maximum and minimum values for uncertain or imprecise spans of dates, measurements, etc.\r\n\r\nTo use Thomas Carlson's example as an illustration, a `<state>` in the person entry for the patriarch Shem'on, whose tenture began some time between 1382 and 1430 and ended sometime between 1444 and 1477, might be encoded as:\r\n\r\n~~~~\r\n<state from=\"1382\" to=\"1477\">\r\n   <precision match=\"@from\" atLeast=\"1382\" atMost=\"1430\"/>\r\n   <precision match=\"@to\" atLeast=\"1444\"  atMost=\"1477\"/>\r\n   <p>Catholicos-Patriarch of the Church of the East.</p> \r\n</state>\r\n~~~~\r\n\r\nThis seems like a simple omission at the time of the creation of this element, and I propose it should be added as a bug-fix as soon as possible.",

  "description": "The regular expression syntax for the @matchPattern attribute in att.patternReplacement is defined as W3C XML Schema regex (for which I'm responsible, IIRC, so mea culpa). Hugh Cayless points out that by default, XML Schema regexes are anchored at both ends, which is severely restrictive. Instead, I think we should redefine it as XPath syntax:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-functions/#regex-syntax\r\n\r\nwhich is based on XML Schema but adds a number of useful extras, including the availability of explicit anchors. I think this is just a corrigible error, and since the current definition is subsumed in the broader one I now propose, we can make this change with no detrimental effects.",

  "description": "Elena wrote on TEI-L, \"the TEI tend elsewhere to clearly distinguish editors from scribes: for instance scribal addition are encoded by `<add>`, editorial's by `<supplied>`; analogously, scribal deletions are encoded with `<del>` and editorial's with `<surplus>`.\" (See http://listserv.brown.edu/archives/cgi-bin/wa?A2=TEI-L;256a9cd2.1310 .)\r\n\r\nIf this is true, I think we need to adjust the Guidelines in a number of ways:\r\n\r\n1. Section 3.4.3 ( #COEDADD ) should mention not only `<supplied>` but also `<surplus>`.  I suggest putting this extra discussion in the final paragraph, where we discuss `<unclear>` and `<gap>`.\r\n\r\n2. The `<specList>` of elements at the beginning of section 34.3 ( #COEDADD ) should include both `<supplied>` and `<surplus>`.\r\n\r\n3. The definitions of `<add>` and `<del>` should not claim that these elements is used for additions by an annotator or corrector.",

        "text": "I think I agree this distinction needs to be formally and clearly made, and probably isn't really at the moment. But I don't agree about the wording of `<add>` and `<del>`. It's all down to the perspective of the encoder. `<surplus>` says \"I am marking these characters out\", `<del>` says \"Somebody has marked these characters out\". So `<add>` and `<del>` might indeed be used for corrections by a *previous* annotator or corrector. \r\n\r\nBut I do think it's worth looking at this section and the related ones and making sure the point Elena makes is properly explained. And explaining `<supplied>` and `<surplus>` alongside `<add>` and `<del>` might indeed be sensible.",

I can't find this stated in the Guidelines but believe it should be added.  When doing so, be sure not to call the Guidelines prose \"the prose\" because it could lead someone to think we are referring to text appearing within a spec as opposed to the content model specified therein.",

      {
        "text": "Please take the following as an expression of concern, made (obviously) without knowing the context of the decision above. And hopefully unnecessary.\r\n\r\nAt least two milestones are relevant as the basis for what I want to say: (i) the switch from Pizza Chef to ODD, as a tighter and in many ways more accessible mechanism for defining TEI vocabulary and _sharing_ it (the requirement of supplying the ODD also matters) and (ii) the recent delegation of even more power to the ODD language.\r\n\r\nBack in 2001, when I fell in love with Lou at first sight, he preached about the Chef and about how the Guidelines supplement the SGML (freshly turned into SGML-like XML) with instructions for interpretation and hints for interoperability. Then came ODD, which made it possible to state many requirements more thoroughly, explicitly, and to more closely connect the verbal description with its machine-readable expression, along the Knuthian principles. (There was a shift of balance there, and this is the core of this note).\r\n\r\nVery recently, ODD gained even more power, abstracting half a step further away from RNG, and arguably maturing in the process.\r\n\r\nNow, I am somewhat concerned with the message that Kevin relayed above, at least the way I understand it, because what it makes me think of is a step backwards towards the times when the TEI _had to_ rely on prose, because it had no means of uniform and powerful expression. But now it does! And the message that can be (hopefully mis-)read as saying \"when in doubt, ignore the ODD and rely on the prose\" seems to me exactly the wrong message to send, because it suggests that the balance is getting pushed back, away from the freshly upgraded ODD, and towards the prose (and in which language? isn't the ODD a way to formally express what the individual translators may render imprecisely in their target languages?)\r\n\r\nThe role of the Council is to maintain and develop the Guidelines, among others by maintaining the underlying ODD. So, I would say, if there is a discrepancy, it means that the Council messed up (a perfectly human thing) and should get the problem fixed -- and thus \"when in doubt, communicate\": maybe someone is late with the prose description, maybe they forgot to commit, or maybe the two _are_ in agreement, except that someone expressed that agreement very poorly.\r\n\r\nBah, as I said above, I hope that this note is completely unnecessary. Keep up the good frog!\r\n\r\n;-)",

The only solution I imagine is adding a statement saying that the notion of semantic conformance cannot be completely enforced in a formal way so the prose is to be considered part of the conformance notion; if there is an evident inconsistency between Guidelines prose and specs that is to be considered and error to be reported to Council.

For example, the spec for `att.transcriptional` has a `<listRef>` pointing to `#ST`, which discusses the TEI infrastructure and happens to define `att.transcriptional`, rather than to `#PH`, where these attributes are actually discussed.  I think this problem is unique to `#ST`, which contains all sorts of things not actually explained in that chapter.  But in the user interface it sends the user to a chapter irrelevant to the class.\r\n\r\nIn cases like this, perhaps we should add a second `<listRef>` to point to the chapter where the elements or attributes in the class are actually discussed.  Or perhaps we should just remove the reference to `#ST`.",

This remains true of most elements but not, unfortunately, of attribute classes, some of which are  first defined in ST as dummies, but not actually discussed until much later. The links to ST for attribute classes need to be reviewed, as Kevin suggests, and an additional reference to the places where they are properly discussed added.\r\n",

The one possible exception\r\n(perhaps the one Kevin had in mind) is in the description of\r\ndata.temporal.iso and data.temporal.w3c. There the phrase is correctly\r\nused, but arguably we could be more precise, e.g.:\r\n\r\n   defines the range of attribute values used to normalize a temporal\r\n   expression to the international standard ...\r\n\r\nI have not made this change, but will put it into a new ticket so that\r\nCouncil will consider it.\r\n\r\n\r\n> b) I suspect \"date & time\" is supposed to refer to what the W3C\r\n>    recommendation calls \"dateTime\".\r\n\r\nKevin is correct, the W3C name for the datatype that expresses a date\r\nand time within that date (i.e., what in English is referred to as a\r\n\"date and time\") is \"dateTime\". I don't know if Kevin is implying that\r\nthe TEI Guidelines should also say \"dateTime\" here, but they certainly\r\nshould not. a) The phrases in question are written in English and\r\nrefer to the concept, not in standardese referring to the datatype. b)\r\nOne of the phrases in question is talking about ISO formats, not W3C\r\nformats.\r\n\r\nThis issue is \"closed-wont-fix\" as far as I'm concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n> c) \"using the Gregorian calendar\" seems redundant since as far as I\r\n>    can tell the W3C recommendation refers only to the Gregorian\r\n>    calendar.\r\n\r\nYes, it is redundant. But it is a good idea to be redundant here, as\r\nmany scholars don't realize that using W3C date formats implies use of\r\nthe Gregorian system. You can use proleptic Gregorian in these\r\nformats, though, and perhaps we should say that. I plan to open a new\r\nticket so Council can consider adding a phrase about proleptic\r\nGregorian.\r\n\r\n\r\n> 4. ... drop the phrase \"Any string representing a valid date, time,\r\n>    or one of a variety of combinations.\" (from att.datable.iso)\r\n>    since it's misleading given ...\r\n\r\nNot sure what Kevin is referring to here. That phrase does not appear\r\nin att.datable.iso, and has not since before the bug report was\r\nsubmitted.

Cf. http://tei-l.970651.n3.nabble.com/multiple-msIdentifiers-tp2416599p2416117.html)\r\n* since several child elements of &lt;msIdentifier&gt; could simply be pointers (e.g.  &lt;repository ref=\"my:repo\"/&gt;) the check for empty text will falsely fail\r\n\r\nI'm not sure whether this rule is needed anyway but if so it should be updated.\r\n\r\nThe current constraint for convenience:\r\n\r\n~~~~~~\r\n  <constraint>\r\n    <report xmlns=\"http://purl.oclc.org/dsdl/schematron\" test=\"not(parent::tei:msPart) and (local-name(*[1])='idno' or local-name(*[1])='altIdentifier' or normalize-space(.)='')\">An msIdentifier must contain either a repository or location of some type, or a manuscript name</report>\r\n  </constraint>\r\n~~~~~~\r\n\r\n",

        "text": "If I understand this correctly the schematron rule is trying to enforce the idea that an msDesc/msIdentifier needs to have some location, repository, or identification (whereas an msPart/msIdentifier has no such restriction). I think we took this to be the minimal required information about a manuscript or set of manuscript bits.\r\n\r\nIn the example of the given of a logical object scattered in different institutions the msDesc/msIdentifier is identifying the logical object of which you speak.  When you speak of it, doesn't it have an identifier or msName of some sort? If you can't talk about the object as a virtually or once-combined object then it seems strange to have a description about it.  The post linked to is now wrong (in that you can't just have altIdentifier any more it seems) but you just need one country or similar element, or repository or idno or msName or similar.  I believe the argument is that you almost always have an idno or msName. If you are virtually reconstructing this ms from pieces scattered in different countries, then surely the idno or msName is the name or idno that _you_ give to identify this collected ms?  The individual idno's for each scrap go inside their msPart obviously. \r\n\r\nThe check for empty text is a fairly limited one (trying to stop people just putting in contentless elements. But I suppose could check for a @ref as well.  I think it a good idea to test for where someone has put a repository but no text in it.  (I'd still be tempted to suggest your repository example should have a human-readable blob of text in it....)\r\n\r\nJust thinking out loud,\r\n\r\n-James\r\n\r\n",

Similarly, it's silly to say that something is recommended when applicable; how could it be recommended when it's not applicable, and how could rwa be different from simply \"recommended\", which also exists?\r\n\r\nI recommend (if applicable) removing mwa and rwa from this list.",

        "text": "I understand how it can be confusing, but I don't think it's a bug at all. It's a tool useful when you want an extra-precise encoding that would group variants together. For instance, your lemma in ms A reads \"year\", in ms B you have a variant \"years\" (same word), and in ms B you have \"month\" and in ms C \"nomth\". You might encode that as\r\n<app>\r\n<lem wit=\"A\">year</lem>\r\n<rdg wit=\"B\">years</rdg>\r\n<rdg wit=\"C\">month</rdg>\r\n<rdg wit=\"D\">nomth</rdg>\r\n</app>\r\n\r\nBut it is frustrating, because it put on the same level A, B, C, while obviously B is much closer to A. Also, it does not make clear that C and D probably belong in the same branch of the tradition, since D is just a spelling mistale on the same word as C. So you might want to encode this like that:\r\n\r\n<app>\r\n<lem wit=\"A\">year</lem>\r\n<rdg wit=\"B\">years</rdg>\r\n<rdgGrp>\r\n<lem wit=\"C\">month</lem>\r\n<rdg wit=\"D\">nomth</rdg>\r\n</rdgGrp>\r\n</app>\r\n\r\nHere, the <lem/> in the rdgGrp means that this is the preferred, right version of ths variant, but not that it should be in the main text of the edition.\r\n\r\nIf anything, it seems to me we would need a <lemGrp/> element, so we could have a clearer encoding for people who use <lem/> elements in their <app/> (for some reason, many TEI people seem to think that it's smarter NOT to use <lem/> and only put <rdg/> in your text. As an editor, I don't relate to that).\r\n\r\nYou are right, though, that the note is inconsistent with the schema. I would still argue that the possibility of marking a preferred reading in each rdgGrp is potentially useful. ",

We need to make a clear case of all the use cases where terms are sequences tagged in a text and pointing to a reference description, whether a definition within the same text (not mainstream to my view) or an external reference. Sebastian mentions thesauri, but it could also be a real terminology (with a multilingual representation). This is typically what we have in the structure of an ISO standard with a distinct \"terms and definitions\" section. In such cases, this supports the idea that we should have a terminology chapter again somewhere or means to describe TBX like objects as presented in http://hal.inria.fr/hal-00950862 (with a first ODD and examples).",

To avoid confusion, and as this is metadata that is created during the process of digital editing (right, this does not relate to revisions of a text prior to going digital?), I would also prefer have a mandatory date on the change.\r\n\r\nWhile trying to whip up a rule to fomally check whether dated <change&gt;s are in the correct order, I found that this is indeed ambigous when allowing for more than @when, @when-iso; especially @from @to are problematic. Some combinations are hard to put in order (without defining a sorting-precedence on either the time of start or end of change). In any case, if we want to be prescriptive, I think we should be unambigous.\r\n\r\nOne aspect we should not change in P5 though, that is the direction of ordering. While I think that actual chronologic order and document order should align, I think this is not something we should consider to change now. Generally, maybe for later, I would strongly recommend on having the earliest change first and the latest change last. Aligning the direction of document-order and temporal order makes a much stronger metaphor, which works for most people out of the box without having much to explain. Having version control systems spitting out the most recent changes first is a convenience primarily designed for the command line. This is something I am well used to, so I immediately know why <revisionDesc> is ordered as it is in TEI, but I think this needs much more clarification and explanation (and leads deviant encoding practices). Hence, I think it would be much more sensible to align this with the document-order. (Just as I expect <u&gt;s in a theatre play to be in document-order or a <list&gt; to be read top-down)",

London: Collins\"), given the multitude of editions of the CED. It may be the online version of CED, but that version has different text in its entries from what is provided in this chapter... The world and the CED have moved on, for sure, but the biblio reference does not indicate that.\r\n\r\nSeveral procedures suggest themselves. One is: throw Sampa away altogether, this isn't meant to be a museum... Next: update the inline examples for what the referenced dictionaries REALLY provide (hint: it's not Sampa).

This means it can't simply refer to att.media, but instead copies all the other attributes, alongside the revised @mimeType. So the effect is it gets the right attributes but by copy instead of reference. The generated documentation does not show this clearly at all.\r\n\r\nThere is a requirement, one of these days, to review the documentation generated from ODD and work out better ways of showing what is in the source. As it stands, its lossy. But it is not at all a simple matter to fix, as the process described above is integral to the way the ODD-flattening is done.

I'm similarly torn but would reluctantly agree with the repurposing of lem and rdg.\r\n\r\nI don't, however, deny that there is a need for either some clear guidance (in using existing solutions) or a new element for block apparatus use. In creating that new element we should be very careful that its semantics and use are clear and mitigate those problems of overlap where possible.  Inside this new element's rdgs there may well need to be structural duplication and I would argue for a solution which needed to duplicate some text/markup but where possible used the existing global attributes @copyOf @sameAs or similar to reduce this where possible.\r\n\r\nI would vote against taking app and just modifying where it can appear.",

My own understanding is that a critical edition is a constructed text that provides evidence supporting the editor's argument for its construction and alternatives where they are deemed relevant. Therefore, any TEI critical edition would need to conform to TEI's Abstract Model and if you wanted to align sources where one has a paragraph and the other a chapter, you'd have to make it work (by, e.g., wrapping the paragraph in a div).\r\n\r\nThe question is: are you asking for a mechanism for bypassing the TEI Abstract Model, or do you just want to be able to put larger structures in lem/rdg with the understanding that those structures should be parallel?\r\n\r\nPut another way, should your document still be valid if the critical apparatus elements were removed from it?

        "text": "Hi Hugh! \r\n\r\nNo, I'm not asking for a mechanism to bypass the TEI abstract model. What is really much needed is the possibility to put `<div>` or `<p>` or `<lg>` or even `<l>` in a <lem> or <rdg>. In most cases that will be quite straightforward, and I can't think of examples of editions I know where a paragraph would happen within another paragraph. Besides, as you point out, editions are contructed by the editor, so extreme / borderline cases should be dealt with by adapting the structure of the edition (wrapping the paragraph in a div in your example).\r\n\r\nThe main use of this correction will be, really, the ability to encode simply large omissions or additions, but especially to encode different versions of a text tradition, when for instance a \"chanson de geste\" has two different possible ending chapters, according to different families of manuscripts. The current situation is especially cumbersome when you are dealing with verse: my intial is precisely a Chanson de geste in verse with 2 possible endings. The ending sections are totally different, the number of stanza is different and they don't even have the same number of verses. Yet, in the present state, the TEI expects you to have <app> only with a *verse*, which philologically does not make any sense, because a verse in version 1 does not correspond directly to a verse in version 2. But if we can wrap each set of stanza in an <rdg>, then everybiody is happy: that's what philologists want, and the TEI abstract model is not the least abused. \r\n\r\nCheers, \r\nMarjorie",

A better recipe for moribundity and stagnation could hardly be devised.\r\n\r\nIn any case, this particular change doesn't affect backward compatibility in the way we normally define it: TEI documents which were valid against previous versions of p5_all are still valid against the new version of p5_all, and ODD files which were previously valid are still valid. It's just that processing old ODD files against the new source will cause a problem.
