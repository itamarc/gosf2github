  "description": "At present, the elements you need to record information \r\nabout real people in a P5 document are scattered across \r\nseveral modules.\r\n\r\nThe Corpora module defines &lt;partic&gt; and &lt;particDesc&gt; \r\nfor participants in a transcribed text. These allow for \r\nany number of so-called \"demographic\" subelements, \r\nsuch as &lt;birth&gt;, &lt;occupation&gt;, &lt;residence&gt; etc.\r\n\r\nThe Names and Dates module defines &lt;persName&gt; and \r\nvarious subcomponents for names of people, but \r\nresolutely eschews any attempt to describe reality: it's \r\nonomastic, rather than prosopographic, by design.\r\n\r\nThe new Manuscript Description module defines a \r\n&lt;listPerson&gt; elementand a &lt;person&gt; element to fill it. \r\nThis  contains some of the same elements as &lt;partic&gt; \r\nbut also adds some. For example, &lt;birth&gt; is in the \r\ncorpora module, but &lt;death&gt; is in the MS one. \\(Not \r\nreally surprising, since the people manuscript describers \r\nare interested in are usually dead, whereas the people \r\ncorpus encoders are concerned with usually aren't\\)\r\n\r\nWe could resolve this confusion  by creating a new \r\nstandalone module, or by groiuping all related elements \r\nin one place. More precisely:\r\n\r\n\\(a\\) we could define an entirely new module concerned \r\nwith prosopographic information, defining &lt;listPerson&gt; \r\nand &lt;person&gt; and their children, and remove &lt;partic&gt; \r\nand &lt;particDesc&gt; from the corpora module\r\n\r\n\\(b\\) we could do essentially  the same but add the new \r\nelements to the core module\r\n\r\n\\(c\\) we could do essentially the same, but add the new \r\nelements to the names and dates module\r\n\r\nThe reactions to this proposal on TEI-L \\(9-10 may 04\\) \r\nso far suggest that option \\(c\\) is preferred.",

Anything in the\r\nhacked metadata that proves itself worthy of being kept\r\nthrough the ages can be given a canonical TEI home.\r\n\r\nMaybe think of the metadata hack as a probationary area\r\nwhere potential header-type tags can be tried out? By the\r\nway, I set out to use Dublin Core, but gave up trying to\r\nbend the metadata requirements of the present papyrology\r\nproject into the DC shape. Papyrologists want to be able to\r\nuse a lot of metadata fields \\(see APIS, for example\\) --\r\nprovenance is merely an example of the desiderata. Things\r\nare still in a state of flux.

The subtype should relate to the element, not one \r\nof its attributes. USD is not a subtype of measure, it's \r\n\\(possibly\\) a subtype of currency. Also, the reg attribute in \r\nthe above example is being expected to do two different \r\nthings: regularize the currency name and regularize the \r\nmeasurement itself. So \\(unless we want to use different \r\nattributes for this purpose which seems like overkill\\) it ought \r\nto be 'reg=\"USD 8.00\"' \\(or CAD or HKD or...\\)\r\n\r\nSyd comments that the Guidelines should suggest exactly \r\nhow currencies be encoded without relying on\r\nsubtype, which seems entirely right.    He also suggests \r\nsomething like   &lt;measure type=\"currency\" reg=\"37.54 \r\nEUR\"&gt;$45.70&lt;/measure&gt;  \r\nwhich I think is also a misuse of \"reg\" -- it doesn't \r\nmean \"equivalent at today's trading rate\".",

Take it with a grain of salt ... or two.\r\n\r\nSince \"in its fullest form, a measure consists of a number,\r\na phrase expressing units of measure, and a phrase\r\nexpressing the commodity being measured\", I'm inclined to\r\nsay that type= of &lt;measure&gt; should be dropped in favor of\r\nthree attributes, let's call them num=, unit=, and stuff=.\r\nThis permits regularization of each component of the measure\r\nseparately, and thus also would permit us a more precise\r\nsemantics of reg= \\(either the normalization of num= or the\r\nnormalization of both num= and unit= together; might even\r\nwant to call it norm=, removing &lt;measure&gt; from the name\r\nclass, thus removing the key= attribute, which I daresay\r\nseems a bit silly, although perhaps I'm overlooking\r\nsomething here\\).\r\nHowever, this doesn't actually address the problem John was\r\npointing out, which is that sometimes it's useful to\r\nindicate what dimension \\(wrong word, but I can't think of a\r\nbetter one right now\\) a particular unit is measuring. So\r\njust as \"CAD\", \"SEK\", and \"EUR\" are all units of \"currency\",\r\nit is also the case that \"metre\", \"mile\", and \"light-year\"\r\nare all units of \"distance\". It is reasonable to expect that\r\nat times people may wish to indicate this larger category\r\ninstead of or in addition to the actual unit.\r\nBut before we go attribute-crazy, we need to also think\r\nabout which of these bits of information need to be elements\r\nrather than attributes \\(such that information about them,\r\ne.g. their language, can be supplied\\).",

        "text": "Logged In: YES \nuser\\_id=686243\n\nThe value= attribute of &lt;interp&gt; and &lt;span&gt; is one of the\r\nthornier\r\nones to deal with in our quest to rid TEI of \"content textual\r\nattributes\". I see two possible ways of thinking about the\r\nvalue of\r\nvalue=. First, we might think of it as being used to provide,\r\ndirectly, the interpretation of the indicated element\\(s\\).\r\nSecond, it\r\nmight be thought of as a key which is used to look up the actual\r\ninterpretation, possibly in the human readers' mind.\r\n\r\nIf the first is the case, it obviously makes sense to make\r\nthe value=\r\nattribute a child of &lt;interp&gt; or &lt;span&gt; instead.\r\nPossibilities for\r\nthe child include:\r\n\r\n\\*  Zero or more characters, without markup. Does not satisfy\r\nAndreas's request for allowing markup inside the value.\r\n\r\n\\*  Paragraph-type content \\(characters plus phrase level\r\nelements,\r\ni.e. the P5 equivalent of %paraContent;\\).\r\n\r\n\\*  A new element, e.g. &lt;value&gt;, created for this purpose.\r\nBesides\r\nvery clear semantics, this has the advantage that if\r\n&lt;value&gt; is\r\nallowed to repeat, the elements &lt;interpGrp&gt; and &lt;spanGrp&gt;\r\ncould\r\nbe dropped, in favor of permitting &lt;interp&gt; and &lt;span&gt; to\r\ncontain\r\nthemselves. The content of &lt;value&gt; would be permitted to\r\ncontain\r\nphrase-level markup, giving it more expressive power than an\r\nattribute, and satisfying Andreas's request.\r\n\r\n\\*  A &lt;p&gt; \\(or perhaps &lt;seg&gt; or &lt;ab&gt;\\), or perhaps one or more of\r\nthem. This has the advantage of using an already existing\r\nelement.\r\n\r\nIn all of these cases the intent is that the interpretation is\r\nwritten out long hand, as it were. So one can imagine rather\r\nthan\r\njust \"foreshadowing\", an interpretation with more detail:\r\n\"foreshadowing &lt;name key=\"LS\"&gt;Luke&lt;/name&gt;'s return to &lt;place\r\nkey=\"YP\"&gt;Dagobah&lt;/place&gt; in &lt;rs key=\"SWE6RotJ\"&gt;episode 6&lt;/rs&gt;.\"\r\n\r\nOne can easily imagine, of course, that folks would use this for\r\nother things, e.g. for commentary on the interpretation\r\nitself, or\r\nfor explanations of why other interpretations were\r\ndismissed, etc. It\r\nis not at all clear to me whether such use would be a good\r\nthing or a\r\nbad thing, an argument in favor or against this permissiveness.\r\n\r\nIf the second possibility \\(that the value of value= should\r\nbe thought\r\nof as a key used to look up the interpretation\\) is the case,\r\nthen the\r\nvalue of value= \\(e.g., \"aftermath\"\\) should not be thought of\r\nas a\r\ncomplete interpretation itself, but rather as a key with\r\nwhich the\r\nuser can determine the interpretation, e.g. via a computer table\r\nlook-up or by knowing what the word means in a natural\r\nlanguage \\(sort\r\nof a table look-up in the brain, as it were\\). The actual\r\ninterpretation could be spelled out somewhere \\(\"the section\r\nof the\r\nnarative following the climax which describes the negative\r\nresults of\r\nthe protaganists' actions\" -- OK, I'm not a literature\r\nscholar, you\r\nget the idea\\) or left open to interpretation. In the former\r\ncase, the\r\nvalue itself is just a string; it may be purposefully\r\ndesigned to\r\nresemble a word in some natural language, but as far as computer\r\nsystems are concerned could just as well be a random\r\nsequence. In the\r\nlatter case some mnemonic string is used to jog a reader's\r\nmemory, as\r\nit were. In neither of these cases does using internal\r\nmarkup seem to\r\nbe necessary of even make sense.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if value= is just a key into a \\(computer or\r\nmental\\) table lookup, why not call it key=? For that matter,\r\nwhy not\r\npermit it to actually point directly to the full\r\ninterpretation \\(by\r\nbeing a URI\\)? In which case the full itnerpretation could\r\ncontain any\r\nkind of markup you like, i.e. might even be in a markup language\r\nother than TEI.\r\n",

Retain the 'value' attribute, perhaps\r\nrenaming it 'key', and have the content of &lt;interp&gt; contain\r\nthe tei.pervasive note-like interpretation.  To use Syd's\r\nexample:\r\n\r\n&lt;interp id=\"LukeDago1\" resp=\"SB\" key=\"foreshadow\"&gt;\r\nThis foreshadows &lt;name key=\"LS\"&gt;Luke&lt;/name&gt;'s return to \r\n&lt;place key=\"YP\"&gt;Dagobah&lt;/place&gt; in \r\n&lt;rs key=\"SWE6RotJ\"&gt;episode 6&lt;/rs&gt;.\r\n&lt;/interp&gt;\r\n\r\nThis allows markup in the interpretation, and a key by which\r\nall instances of foreshadowing \\(or whatever\\) can easily be\r\npulled out.  I certainly wouldn't want to do away with a\r\nkey-like attribute.  \\(However, it could be argued that @n /\r\n@type could be misappropriated for this.\\)  The example in P4\r\n15.3 uses @id/@ana for this because, I believe, it wants to\r\nhighlight that it \"does not itself indicate which passage of\r\ntext is being interpreted; the same interpretive structures\r\ncan thus be associated with many passages of the text\". \r\nThis does not mean that someone should not use it to provide\r\nmore specific interpretations rather than a general \"there\r\nis some foreshadowing here\".  \r\n\r\nThe element does seem to be part of those which are\r\n\"descriptive or identifying elements which characterize and\r\nobject\\[ify\\]\", and so unless I'm misunderstanding it, Lou's\r\nsuggestion of macro.glossSeq makes sense.\r\n\r\nOf course, if @value was renamed @key, then that might\r\ncreate some possible confusion with the way @key is used\r\nelsewhere, esp. in tei.entries.\r\nThis @key-like attribute could be provided on interGrp, but\r\nthen would this necessitate that the &lt;interp&gt; all be grouped\r\ntogether, rather than allowing for the possibility of\r\ndynamically grouping interpretations together in some way?\r\n\r\nMy two pence,\r\n\r\n-James",

Given the desire that the content of\r\n&lt;interp&gt; be a direct description, I'm not sure that either\r\n&lt;altIdent&gt; or &lt;equiv&gt; make sense whatsoever. &lt;gloss&gt; and\r\n&lt;desc&gt; make some sense, although &lt;gloss&gt; is a bit of a\r\nstretch, and has only phrase-level content. That leaves\r\n&lt;desc&gt;, which has the mild disadvantage that we'd need to\r\nrealign its semantics a bit. And, as has been pointed out\r\nhere, it is reasonable to believe that more than one\r\nparagraph level thing would be needed, so if we were to use\r\n&lt;desc&gt; instead of &lt;p&gt;, it \\(the content model of &lt;interp&gt;\\)\r\nshould probably be \\( desc+ \\), no?\r\n\r\nAlso, with respect to where it goes, I don't know the\r\ndetails of your proposed tei.pervasive class, but I'm\r\nguessing it would be where things that can go in lots of\r\nplaces, but not just anywhere \\(like tei.Incl\\) would go. In\r\nwhich case, why would &lt;interp&gt; need to be in it? It doesn't\r\nneed to be permissible in lots of places. Since the ana=\r\nattribute of elements in the text point to &lt;interp&gt;, it\r\ncould be anywhere \\(including in a different file\\); since the\r\nfrom=, to=, \\(and interp=\\) attributes of &lt;span&gt; point to an\r\nelement or elements in the text, it could be anywhere. Seems\r\nto me the Guidelines should simply say where they're\r\nsupposed to be, period.\r\n\r\nJames suggests a key= for &lt;interp&gt;. John suggests that n=\r\nand type= are suitable for this purpose. I like the idea of\r\nretaining an attribute value for this purpose. I think key=\r\nis probably not quite right, and that n= is simply a bad\r\nidea -- this is not a label. But type= makes a lot of sense.\r\nMy only concern is that if we appropriate type= to be used\r\nfor a general classification of an interpretation \\(where the\r\ncontent is used for a detailed description of it\\), are we\r\nrobbing people of the ability to use type= of &lt;interp&gt; for\r\nsome other useful purpose? I.e., is there reason to believe\r\nthat users will want both type= and\r\nthat-which-used-to-be-value= as separate attributes? I'm\r\ninclined to think not, but there may be counter examples ...\r\n",

Change levenN= attributes to child elements. This is a\r\ngood idea; such a good idea, it is already on the list of\r\nthings to do for P5. We have not, however, come up with a\r\ngood name for this child element. Suggestions welcome. \\(I,\r\nfor one, am not fond of Andreas's &lt;indexLabel&gt;.\\)\r\n\r\n2\\. Use &lt;indexContent&gt; \\(I think Andreas intends this to hold,\r\nrather than replicate, source content, but I'm not sure.\\)\r\nI'm iffy on this one; overall I don't think I like it, but\r\ncan't elucidate why very well. I'd prefer the DocBook zone=\r\nmethod \\(if I understand it correctly\\), I think.\\[1\\]\r\n\r\n3\\. Permit a pointer child to &lt;index&gt; for\tredirecting the\r\nreader to a different index entry. While it's probably a\r\ngood idea to provide this kind of functiaonality, I have a\r\nfeeling that by the time one is getting this complicated XTM\r\nis really the better way to go.\r\n\r\nAnd, as an alternate to the above\r\n4\\. Adopt the DocBook index model. I am not thoroughly\r\nknowledgable about the DocBook model, but I'm worried that\r\nit tries to do too much \\(or at least, more than we need\\) at\r\nonce and therefore makes usage & processing more difficult\r\nthan need be.\r\n\r\nNote\r\n\\----\r\n\\[1\\] I think the DocBook zone= method works such\r\nthat rather than look at the spot where\r\n&lt;index&gt; element appears in the text, the\r\nindex generation software takes as that\r\nwhich is to be indexed the target of the\r\nzone= attribute. In the TEI world we'd\r\nprobably use a target= attribute, and the\r\nsemantics would be that the default value of\r\ntarget= \\(\"default\" here meaning what\r\nsoftware should do if it finds no value, not\r\nwhat the schema should say is provided as a\r\ndefault value\\) is the &lt;index&gt; element\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n",

Is &lt;relatedBiblItem&gt; needed? \r\n\r\nI have to agree that a nested &lt;biblItem&gt; would serve as well\r\nas a &lt;relatedBiblItem&gt;, perhaps making the &lt;relatedBiblitem&gt;\r\nunnecessary.  It was others who proposed the\r\n&lt;relatedBiblItem&gt; element. If they responded, perhaps they\r\ncould make the reason for &lt;relatedBiblItem&gt; clearer.\r\n\r\nFor myself, I can't think of any good reasons why a\r\n&lt;biblItem&gt; won't do for  a &lt;relatedBiblitem&gt;. By  its parent\r\nelements, as well as the attributes we proposed, a\r\n&lt;biblItem&gt; should never have an ambiuous relationship. ",

  "description": "According to the examples in P4, \u00a7 6.10, &lt;extent&gt; can \nbe used for specifying the number of pages of a \nbibliographic item like a book. Another reasonable usage \nof &lt;extent&gt; would be, for instance, the specification of \nthe total number of volumes of a multi-volume book. \n\nAs &lt;extent&gt; does not have a \"type\" attribute, measure \nstrings like \"pp.\" oder \"vols\" have to be included into its \ncontent. This is unfortunate in cases where \nbibliographic data shall be stored in a language- and \nstyle-neutral way. \n\nIn addition, &lt;biblScope type=\"pages\"&gt; cannot simply be \nsubstituted for &lt;extent type=\"pages\"&gt; because of their \ndistinct semantics. &lt;biblScope&gt; defines the \n'scope'--some part--of a bibliographic item \\(say, a \ncollection\\) with respect to some subitem \\(e.g., an \narticle\\). &lt;extent&gt;, on the other hand, measures the \nwhole \\(e.g., the collection\\). \n\nSo the xml-biblio group \\(cf. the archives of the \nxml-biblio-discuss@lists.sourceforge.net mailing list\\) \nproposes to add a \"type\" attribute to &lt;extent&gt; with \nsuggested values similar to those of like &lt;biblScope&gt;'s \n\"type\" attribute. \n\nHere is an example, using P4's &lt;biblStruct&gt; model: \n\n&lt;biblStruct&gt; \n&lt;analytic&gt; \n&lt;author&gt; \n&lt;persName&gt; \n&lt;forename&gt;Edward&lt;/forename&gt; \n&lt;forename&gt;L.&lt;/forename&gt; \n&lt;surname&gt;Keenan&lt;/surname&gt; \n&lt;/persName&gt; \n&lt;/author&gt; \n&lt;author&gt; \n&lt;persName&gt; \n&lt;forename&gt;Dag&lt;/forename&gt; \n&lt;surname&gt;Westerst&amp;\\#xE5;hl&lt;/surname&gt; \n&lt;/persName&gt; \n&lt;/author&gt; \n&lt;title lang=\"eng\" level=\"a\"&gt;Generalized Quantifiers in \nLinguistics and Logic&lt;/title&gt; \n&lt;/analytic&gt; \n&lt;monogr&gt; \n&lt;title lang=\"eng\" level=\"m\"&gt;Handbook of Logic and \nLanguage&lt;/title&gt; \n&lt;editor&gt; \n&lt;persName&gt; \n&lt;forename&gt;Johan&lt;/forename&gt; \n&lt;forename&gt;F.&lt;/forename&gt; \n&lt;forename&gt;A.&lt;/forename&gt; \n&lt;forename&gt;K.&lt;/forename&gt; \n&lt;nameLink&gt;van&lt;/nameLink&gt; \n&lt;surname&gt;Benthem&lt;/surname&gt; \n&lt;/persName&gt; \n&lt;/editor&gt; \n&lt;editor&gt; \n&lt;persName&gt; \n&lt;forename&gt;Alice&lt;/forename&gt; \n&lt;nameLink&gt;ter&lt;/nameLink&gt; \n&lt;surname&gt;Meulen&lt;/surname&gt; \n&lt;/persName&gt; \n&lt;/editor&gt; \n&lt;imprint&gt; \n&lt;pubPlace&gt;Amsterdam&lt;/pubPlace&gt; \n&lt;publisher&gt;Elsevier&lt;/publisher&gt; \n&lt;pubPlace&gt;Cambridge, Mass.&lt;/pubPlace&gt; \n&lt;publisher&gt;MIT Press&lt;/publisher&gt; \n&lt;date&gt;1997&lt;/date&gt; \n&lt;/imprint&gt; \n&lt;extent type=\"pages\"&gt;1247&lt;/extent&gt; \n&lt;biblScope \ntype=\"pages\"&gt;837&amp;\\#x2013;893&lt;/biblScope&gt; \n&lt;/monogr&gt; \n&lt;/biblStruct&gt; ",

  "description": "\\- &lt;lg&gt;\r\n\r\nAt Henrik Ibsen's Writings we perform detailed metrical \r\nencoding in all verse texts. Regarding the many verse \r\ndramas, one of the main goals is to mark up the main \r\nverse structures clearly, i.e. the starting and ending \r\npoints of the different meters occuring in the text. As \r\n&lt;lg&gt; is defined in the TEI DTD it seems to be related to \r\npoems only, not to verse dramas. The element may \r\ncontain verse lines, headings, closers and so on, but not \r\ndramatic elements like speeches and stages. To avoid \r\nheavily fragmenting and linking or milestones, we have \r\ndecided to modify our dtd to allow &lt;sp&gt;, &lt;stage&gt; and \r\n&lt;div&gt; inside &lt;lg&gt;. This makes &lt;lg&gt; more parallel to the \r\n&lt;div&gt; element, and we use the &lt;lg&gt; element to mark up \r\nverse structures and the &lt;div&gt; element to mark up the \r\ndrama structures \\(acts and scenes\\). We would suggest \r\na similar change to the TEI DTD.\r\n\r\n\\- additional attributes for metrical analysis\r\n\r\nThe attributes for metrical analysis in TEI P4 are the \r\nmet, real and rhyme attributes. These are intended for \r\nmetrical structure, deviation from the metrical structure \r\nand rhyme scheme respectively. An attribute for \r\ndeviation from the rhyme scheme is not included in the \r\nTEI DTD. We have therefore split the real attribute in \r\nseveral categories: realMet \\(for deviation from metrical \r\nstructure\\) and realRhyme \\(for deviation from rhyme \r\nscheme\\). In addition we have attributes for notation of \r\nanacrusis and deviations attached to these, respectively \r\nthe an and the realAn attribute. These attributes may \r\nhave the values \"single\", \"double\" and \"no\". We would \r\nsuggest these attributes to be included in TEI P5.\r\n\r\nPlease contact Stine Brenna Taugb\u0159l \r\n\\(s.b.taugbol@ibsen.uio.no\\) at Henrik Ibsen's Writings, if \r\nyou have any questions or remarks.",

  "summary": "Manuscript encoding",
  "description": "Henrik Ibsen's Writings has made several changes and \r\nadditions to the TEI DTDs regarding the encoding of \r\nmanuscript changes and manuscript phenomena. In the \r\nfollowing we wish to present some of the modifications \r\nand encourage the inclusion of these themes in the P5 \r\nrevision discussion. \r\n\r\n\\- &lt;clarification&gt;\r\n\r\nWe've created a new element to record the clarification \r\nphenomenon in manuscripts. Ibsen and his copyists some \r\ntimes clarify words or letters either writing upon the \r\nalready written word/letters or by repeating the \r\nword/letters offline. We encode these instances of \r\nrepeating the same for the purpose of clarification, like \r\nthis:\r\n\r\n&lt;clarification hand=\"HI\" \r\nplace=\"inline\"&gt;Henrik&lt;/clarification&gt;\r\n&lt;clarification hand=\"HI\" \r\nplace=\"offline\"&gt;Henrik&lt;/clarification&gt;\r\n\r\nWe believe this is a well known phenomenon for \r\nmanuscript transcribers, and we think it would be a \r\nuseful addition in a revised chapter on \"Transcription of \r\nPrimary Sources\".\r\n\r\n\\- TEI elements for manuscript changes\r\n\r\nWe've made it possible to include almost all kinds of \r\nelements in &lt;app&gt; \\(i.e. in &lt;lem&gt;/&lt;rdg&gt; of course\\), \r\n&lt;add&gt;, &lt;del&gt; etc. and to use &lt;app&gt;, &lt;add&gt;, &lt;del&gt;, \r\n&lt;gap/&gt; etc. almost globally in our manuscript \r\ntranscriptions in order to record manuscript changes in a \r\nway that reflects our view of the changes. E.g. we allow \r\n&lt;div&gt; inside &lt;add&gt; and &lt;del&gt; to make possible the \r\ninclusion or deletion of a complete scene, thus reflecting \r\nthe change in the document structure more clearly.\r\n\r\n\\- The hand attribute\r\n\r\nWe have allowed the hand attribute in &lt;app&gt;, &lt;hi&gt; and \r\n&lt;emph&gt;. Including hand in &lt;app&gt; makes it unnecessary \r\nto use hand both in &lt;add&gt; and &lt;del&gt; when another \r\nhand has revised the text of the manuscript. Using the \r\nhand attribute in &lt;hi&gt; \\(and similarly in &lt;emph&gt;\\) allows \r\nus to record e.g. the red pencil underlining throughout a \r\nmanuscript otherwise written in black ink.\r\n\r\n\\- A new element for substitutions/revision of the &lt;app&gt; \r\nelement\r\n\r\nThe last years there have been discussions on the TEI-L \r\nand elsewhere of the need to modify and revise the \r\n&lt;app&gt; element to make it more useful for manuscript \r\nchanges. Several alternatives have been discussed. At \r\nHenrik Ibsen's Writings we have also discussed this, and \r\nalthough we have managed to use the excisting &lt;app&gt; \r\nelement for the manuscript changes in our material \r\n\\(though with some modifications of what &lt;lem&gt; and \r\n&lt;rdg&gt; can contain and the inclusion of some attributes\\), \r\nwe would like to encourage the expansion of this part of \r\nthe chapter on \"Transcription of Primary Sources\", at \r\nleast an element for encoding substitutions should be \r\nincluded. We dislike the double role of the &lt;app&gt; \r\nstructure, and would feel better having one structure for \r\nmanuscript changes and one for the critical apparatus. \r\nOur use of the &lt;app&gt; element for manuscript changes \r\nhas resulted in us constructing a new element, &lt;tcApp&gt;, \r\nfor our critical apparatus and text critical notes.\r\n\r\nPlease contact Hilde B\u0159e \\(hilde.boe@ibsen.uio.no\\) at \r\nHenrik Ibsen's Writings, if you have any questions or \r\nremarks.",

  "description": "TEI P4 has four elements, &lt;date&gt;, &lt;dateRange&gt;, &lt;time&gt;,\r\nand &lt;timeRange&gt; for encoding and normalizing text that\r\ndescribes a point or period in time. \\(Not counting\r\n&lt;timeline&gt; and &lt;when&gt; which are special purpose\r\nelements for establishing synchronous points.\\)\r\nThe only difference between a date and a time is the\r\nlevel of precision. The quick description of the\r\ndifference between a &lt;date&gt; or &lt;time&gt; and a &lt;dateRange&gt;\r\nor &lt;timeRange&gt; is that the \\*Range describes a period\r\ngreater than the level of precision used.\r\nFurthermore, in its discussion of attributes for these\r\nelements, P4 conflates accuracy and precision \\(and\r\nalso, IIRC, confidence in the accuracy :-\\), and does\r\nnot address whether ranges are inclusive or exclusive.\r\nThus I am suggesting that this mix of elements and\r\nattributes need some attention for P5. Some first\r\nsuggestions follow.\r\n\r\nSince it is easy to indicate a range with the\r\ninternational standard representation of dates and\r\ntimes \\(ISO 8601:2000\\), the \\*Rnage elements are\r\nunnecessary, and should be dropped from P5. The\r\nfollowing example \\(from P4 6.4.4, source is Virginia\r\nWoolf's \\_Mrs.\\_Dalloway\\_\\) demonstrates an encoding of a\r\nrange without &lt;dateRange&gt;.\r\n| Those five years &amp;mdash; \r\n| &lt;date value=\"1918/1923\"&gt;1918 to 1923&lt;/date&gt; \r\n| &amp;mdash; had been, he suspected,\r\n| somehow very important.\r\nThe Guidelines should simply state that the range\r\nspecified on value= is inclusive. E.g.\r\n| &lt;date value=\"1067/1776-07-03\"&gt;After 1066 but before\r\n| American independance&lt;/date&gt;\r\n\\(Which, of course, could also be encoded\r\n| After &lt;date value=\"1066\"&gt;1066&lt;/date&gt; but before\r\n| &lt;date value=\"1776-07-04\"&gt;American indenpendance&lt;/date&gt;\r\nwith the same accuracy and precision\\)\r\n| &lt;date value=\"1869-10-02/1948-01-30\"&gt;during the life\r\n| of the Mahatma&lt;/date&gt;\r\n\r\nThe exact= attribute of &lt;\\*Range&gt; should become the\r\naccuracy= attribute of &lt;date&gt; and &lt;time&gt;. The precision\r\nis indicated by the precision of value=.\r\n\r\nSince a date and time indicate the same thing \\(albeit\r\nwith varying precision\\) and the normalized\r\nrepresentation \\(ISO 8601\\) can include both, the\r\nGuidelines should explicitly state that &lt;time&gt; and\r\n&lt;date&gt; are technically interchangeable.\r\n\r\nThe Guidelines should be explicit about whether a \"T\"\r\nis to be specified between the date and time fields of\r\nan ISO 8601 value=. \\(I.e., whether the contents of\r\nvalue= is an ISO 8601 format date followed by\r\nwhitespace followed by an ISO 8601 time \\(e.g.\r\n\"2004-09-03 15:24Z\"\\) or an ISO 8601 time and date \\(e.g.\r\n\"2004-09-03T15:24Z\"\\). I prefer the latter myself.\r\n\r\nThe Guidelines should explicitly prohibit the notation\r\n\"24:00\" to represent midnight in the value of value=.\r\n\\(This notation \\*is\\* premitted by ISO 8601, one of the\r\nfew indications that it was written by committee :-\\)\r\n\r\nWe can imagine two different uses of the value=\r\nattribute of &lt;date&gt; \\(or &lt;time&gt;, I suppose\\):\r\n1\\. regularize the content of &lt;date&gt; into a format which\r\ncan easily be searched, preferably one that can easily\r\nbe parsed and searched\r\n2\\. normalize the content of &lt;date&gt; to a date along an\r\nagreed upon timeline \\(aka calander system\\)\r\nIt might make sense, then, to separate these into two\r\nseparate attributes, as one may reasonably want\r\ndifferent values for these purposes. For example, one\r\nmight like to regularize the \\*format\\* of the Julian\r\ndates in early modern printing, but may well rather not\r\nbe bothered trying to figure out what the Gregorian or\r\nproleptic Gregorian \\(i.e., normalized\\) value would be.\r\n| &lt;docDate norm=\"1548-04-07\"\r\nreg=\"1548-03-28\"&gt;The.xxviii.day | of &lt;name&gt;Marche&lt;/name&gt;\r\n| &lt;lb/&gt;the yere of our lorde.\r\n| &lt;lb/&gt;M.D.XLVIII.&lt;/docDate&gt;\r\n\r\n",

I'd like to lay out the issues and then share one\r\npreliminary solution I've come up with.\r\n\r\nMy group is going to be dealing with a growing body of\r\nTEI-encoded documentary editions and digitizations of\r\ndocumentary editions. One desideratum in the long run is\r\ngoing to be detailed searching and indexing based on\r\narbitrary date specifications. For example, a reader may\r\nenter a search to return all documents in the collection\r\nthat were or may have been written on 16 June 1775.\r\n\r\nNow the dating of documents lacking unique precise dates is\r\na very complex matter when you're planning for machine\r\nprocessing. \\(See a TEI-L post from a couple years ago for\r\nmore on this:\r\nhttp://listserv.brown.edu/archives/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0207&L=tei-l&P=R1420\r\n\\). A letter may bear a dateline of simply \"Tuesday\";\r\ninternal and/or external evidence may indicate that it must\r\nhave been written sometime from September 1835 through March\r\n1836\\. It's not going to do just to code this with &lt;origin\r\nnotBefore=\"1835-09-01\" notAfter=\"1836-03-31\"&gt; because that\r\ndoesn't provide enough constraining information so that an\r\nautomated search would return this document as a possibility\r\nfor 2 February 1836 but not 3 February 1836.\r\n\r\nI haven't slogged through ISO 8601 enough to know whether it\r\nprovides a robust enough syntax to handle all these cases,\r\nbut I do know that its syntax for recurring time-intervals\r\nis rebarbative. My own first pass at a solution is a\r\n\"constraints\" attribute that would constrain a date range by\r\nallowing as valid dates only those meeting the criteria. A\r\n@constraints value would be something like an XHTML @style\r\nvalue, consisting of a series of subvalues delimited by\r\nsemicolons. For example, to indicate a Tuesday in March or\r\nApril 1835:\r\n\r\n&lt;origin notBefore=\"1835-03-01\" notAfter=\"1835-04-30\"\r\nconstraint=\"m: 3-4; dw: 2\"&gt;\r\n\r\nwhere \"m\" is a numeric month, month range, or\r\ncomma-separated list of discrete months, and \"dw\" is day of\r\nthe week. \"dm\" could be used for day of the month. There are\r\nalso special cases where one knows, usually based on\r\nexternal evidence, that a document must have been written\r\nduring one of several discrete ranges. For example, a letter\r\nby William James is datelined Chicago, and we know from\r\nbiographical evidence that he was there in the spring of\r\n1882 and fall of 1883 \\[I'm making this up\\]; a constraint\r\ncould be represented like so:\r\n\r\n&lt;orig notBefore=\"1882-03-15\" notAfter=\"1883-10-18\"\r\nconstraint=\"ranges: 1882-03-15/1882-04-20,\r\n1883-09-07/1883-10-18\"&gt;\r\n\r\nAutomatic processing can then fairly easily establish the\r\nfirst and last possible date and all possible dates in between.\r\n\r\nThat's about enough to handle search requirements, I think.\r\nAlthough it would be redundant with the \"ranges\" constraint,\r\none could also add for convenience a \"dates\" constraint\r\nwhose value would be a list of one or more unique dates.\r\n\r\nThe one other thing needed for automatic processing of large\r\nnumbers of dated documents is some way to indicate how they\r\nshould be indexed in a generated list if that cannot be\r\ncomputed from other values. For example, to take the\r\npreceding example of the James letter from Chicago, suppose\r\nan editor feels that it really ought to be included at the\r\nend of all the letters from 1882. Or maybe it should be\r\nincluded immediately after a letter from June 1882 that\r\nrefers to Chicago. There's no way to do this via automated\r\nprocessing. So I'd propose one last \"index\" attribute whose\r\ncontent is a single date value to be used as the\r\npseudo-creation date for indexing purposes. So the James\r\nexample could be expanded to\r\n\r\n&lt;orig notBefore=\"1882-03-15\" notAfter=\"1883-10-18\"\r\nconstraint=\"ranges: 1882-03-15/1882-04-20,\r\n1883-09-07/1883-10-18\" index=\"1882-12-31\"&gt;\r\n\r\nto have it indexed with the end-of-1882 letters. \\(Obviously\r\nthere are limits to how much fine-tuning of generated\r\nindexes can be done without creating too many ad hoc\r\nattributes.\\)\r\n\r\nFinally, attributes like these are really needed on the \r\n&lt;docDate&gt; element as well as on &lt;origin&gt;, because where\r\nyou're marking up something like a print edition of\r\ncorrespondence as a single document instance you're not\r\ngoing to be able to use &lt;origin&gt; inside the TEI body without\r\nextending its definition in a way that's probably not\r\njustifiable.\r\n\r\nSo... how much of this makes sense? And to the extent that\r\nit does, which parts of it look like something that should\r\nbe part of P5 rather than project-specific extensions? \r\n\r\nDavid",

One problem with\r\nallowing something like an ISO 8601 date range as the\r\ncontent of a date/@value attribute is that there is no\r\ncorreponding W3C datatype. I.e., if you have &lt;date\r\nvalue=\"1776-12-01/1776-12-31\"&gt;Dec 1776&lt;/date&gt; validation\r\nusing current P5 schema \\(Relax NG or W3C\\) will complain\r\nabout bad attribute content. \r\n\r\nSo date.attributes.value.content would need to be redefined,\r\neither by some rather ugly use of grouping or \\(probably\r\nbetter\\) by creating some user-defined datatypes for things\r\nlike date ranges, and adding them to the content model. \\(Are\r\nthere any user-defined datatypes already in use in P5?

It's hard to see why a\r\n&lt;note&gt; should not be permitted where an &lt;anchor&gt; is. Why is\r\nthe point of attachment of a &lt;note&gt; in\r\n//TEI.2/text/back/div\\[@type=\"notes\"\\] that points to an\r\n&lt;anchor&gt; that appears between \"&lt;/div2&gt;\" and \"&lt;div2&gt;\" more\r\ndubious than one that occurs between those tags directly?\r\n\r\nI'm also not entirely sure why a &lt;note&gt; between \"&lt;/div2&gt;\"\r\nand \"&lt;div2&gt;\" is dubious in the first place. It's a child of\r\n&lt;div1&gt; with a &lt;div2&gt; as its left sibling and a &lt;div2&gt; as its\r\nright sibling. If it has no target= attribute indicating a\r\npoint of attachment, then there is some ambiguity as to\r\nwhether or not it is \"attached\" to the preceding &lt;div2&gt; or\r\nnot, but the same is true when a &lt;note&gt; is encoded inside a\r\n&lt;p&gt; \\(especially if surrounded by whitespace :-\\). While there\r\nis a popular convention that permits thinking of the &lt;note&gt;\r\nas being \"attached\" to the preceding textual unit \\(and\r\nwhether that unit is a word, phrase, clause, or sentence can\r\noften be ambiguous\\), it is only a convention.\r\n\r\nAnd Lou  if you feel disquiet at the idea of a &lt;note&gt; being\r\nused to comment on the encoding of a document, you must feel\r\nan awful lot of conflict, too. Besides the fact that the\r\nGuidelines recommend it \\(17.1.1\\), it was you who taught me\r\n\\(circa early 2002\\) that one can't use an XML comment for\r\nthis purpose as it won't survive many kinds of XML processing.",

As CW says, the &lt;profileDesc&gt; is provided for just such a purpose.\r\nTaking the specific cases you mention:\r\n\r\n\\- the &lt;castList&gt; of a drama if no cast list appeared in the source;\r\nI don't think you should use &lt;castList&gt; unless you are encoding an actual cast list. If there is none in the source, but you want to list the roles within a  dramatic text, I would suggest using &lt;particDesc&gt; \r\n\r\n\\- the keyed list of names that occur in the document\\[1\\]\r\n&lt;particDesc&gt; again\r\n\r\n\\- &lt;timeline&gt; elements\r\nThese perhaps could go in the text somewhere for processing convenience \\(the only systems I know of which implement such things aside from the TEI always put them in the text certainly\\) In which case we might argue foradding these to model.divTop, since if you use them at all you will want them at the start of a section. \r\n\r\n\\- &lt;linkGrp&gt; or &lt;joinGrp&gt; elements\r\nI'm not sure about these, because I'm not sure of how you envisage their being used. What about &lt;interp&gt; and &lt;interpGrp&gt;? \r\n\r\n\\- &lt;note&gt; elements \\(other than those in the &lt;notesStmt&gt;\\)\r\nthat one chooses not to encode in-line or in-place.\\[2\\]\r\nDoesn't this depend very much on your source text? If the notes are actually there in the source text then they should go into the &lt;text&gt;, and whether you put them at the place of attachment, the place of rendition, or in some specially labelled div in back or front really doesn't matter. If they are \\*not\\* present in the text, then they really ought to go in the header, and &lt;notesStmt&gt; is as good a place as any. \r\n\r\nI propose to close this ticket for now \\(i.e. I don't think we've got a clear enough mandate to get it into P5 1.0\\)",

In fact I am tempted to make this more explicit\r\nby removing that weaselly wording about \"postal or other form\" of address, and\r\nsay that &lt;address&gt; means just that: a postal address.\r\n\r\nThere remains the inconvenient fact that in a case such as:\r\n\r\n&lt;address&gt;\r\n&lt;name&gt;Wm Fish&lt;/name&gt;\r\n&lt;addrLine&gt;12 The Larches&lt;/addrLine&gt;\r\n&lt;addrLine&gt;Croydon&lt;/addrLine&gt;\r\n&lt;/address&gt;\r\n&lt;email&gt;bill@fish.co.uk&lt;/email&gt;\r\n\r\nthere is no way of grouping the postal and email address into a single\r\ncomponent, contrary to the way it would typically be presented, e.g. on headed\r\nnotepaper or a signature or whatever. The only way I can see of dealing with\r\nthat would be to introduce another element, such as &lt;addressBlock&gt;, and to\r\ndefine a new model.addressLike class, with members &lt;address&gt; , &lt;email&gt; etc.\r\n\r\nAnother possibility would be to rename the current &lt;address&gt; as &lt;postalAddress&gt;\r\nand rename the proposed &lt;addressBlock&gt; as &lt;address&gt;, but I suspect that would\r\nintroduce more confusion than it resolved.

Therefore,\r\neither the p's should have the type attribute required\r\nto provide something with the function of the former\r\nmsHeading in the P5 or something like msHeading has to\r\nbe kept.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand: If we keep something like msHeading,\r\nI see the need for a group mechanism of author and\r\ntitle within it.\r\n\r\nThe problem: especially in catalogue entries for\r\nmanuscripts consisting of msParts you may face the\r\nsituation that you have more than one\r\nauthor/title-combination in msHeading. How do we make\r\nclear, which author belongs to which title?\r\n\r\nExample: taken from Sankt Gallen, Stiftsbibliothek,\r\nCodex 658 \\(as to see at www.unifr.ch/cesg\\)\r\nTitel: \\(1\\) Robertus Monachus: Geschichte des 1.\r\nKreuzzugs \\(bebildert\\); \\(2\\) Ottokar von Steiermark:\r\n\u00d6sterreichische Reimchronik: Fall Akkons.\r\n\r\nSuggestion: Not a real one, but as far as I can see the\r\nuse of the attribute 'n' doesn't seem to be very\r\nsatisfying.

  "description": "In the Menota project \\(se http://www.menota.org\\) we\r\nhave worked on the problem on addition, deletions etc.\r\nwhat go across structural boarders. The elements\r\n'addSpan' and 'delSpan' is available in P4 and P5, but\r\nhere are for instance no corresponding 'suppliedSpan',\r\n'unclearSpan' to the elements 'supplied' and 'unclear'\r\nwhich might also cross structural boarders. One might\r\nargue also that there should be 'gapspan', 'sicspan',\r\n'corrspan' and 'segspan' elements as well. In the\r\nMenota project we have also added a new elements to\r\nthis of class elements, that is 'expunged' \\(made with\r\nthe element 'del' as model, contains a letter, word or\r\npassage expunged, marked as expunged, or otherwise\r\nindicated as superfluous or spurious in the copy text\r\nby the transcriber or editor. \\). \r\n\r\nThe elements for the span version of those elements\r\nmight be added to P5, but that is a lot of elements to\r\nadd to cover almost the same purpose. It might be a\r\nsimpler solution to make one generic element called\r\n'textSpan' to cover all these cases. The name\r\n'textSpan' is only a suggestion, as there is already an\r\nelement called 'span' in TEI, but that is to cover\r\nsomething else. An attribute 'category' should be use\r\nto indicate which type of span this is.\r\n\r\nA tentative declaration of the generic 'textSpan'\r\nelement might be like this, using the ODD syntax for P5:\r\n\r\n&lt;elementSpec ident=\"textSpan\" mode=\"add\"&gt;\r\n&lt;desc&gt;2004.11.28 TMB: new element defined. The\r\nelement is based on the element TEI 'addSpan'\r\nwith an extra attribute 'category', and to\r\nencode a generic span of text that might be\r\nadded, deleted etc. This element is a milestone. \r\nThe element is made to avoid to make a\r\nseries of 'delSpan', 'suppliedSpan'etc.&lt;/desc&gt;\r\n&lt;classes&gt;\r\n&lt;memberOf key=\"tei.editIncl\" /&gt;\r\n&lt;/classes&gt;\r\n&lt;content&gt;\r\n&lt;rng:empty/&gt;\r\n&lt;/content&gt;\r\n&lt;attList&gt;\r\n&lt;attDef ident=\"category\" usage=\"opt\"&gt;\r\n&lt;datatype&gt;\r\n&lt;rng:text /&gt;\r\n&lt;/datatype&gt;\r\n&lt;valList type=\"open\"&gt;\r\n&lt;valItem ident=\"add\" /&gt;\r\n&lt;valItem ident=\"del\" /&gt;\r\n&lt;valItem ident=\"supplied\" /&gt;\r\n&lt;valItem ident=\"expunged\" /&gt;\r\n&lt;valItem ident=\"unclear\" /&gt;\r\n&lt;valItem ident=\"gap\" /&gt;\r\n&lt;valItem ident=\"seg\" /&gt;\r\n&lt;valItem ident=\"sic\" /&gt;\r\n&lt;valItem ident=\"corr\" /&gt;\r\n&lt;valItem ident=\"other\" /&gt;\r\n&lt;/valList&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;/attDef&gt;\r\n&lt;\\!-- Here follows the same attributes as\r\nused in addSpan --&gt;\r\n&lt;/attList&gt;\r\n&lt;/elementSpec&gt;         \r\n\r\nIt could then be used in the same way is indicated in\r\nthe TEI Guideline for 'addSpan' and 'delSpan'.\r\n\r\nAny comments are welcome on this subject.

If it is only a name, no role attribute\r\nis needed and I withdraw my proposal. Do you want encoders\r\nto transform &lt;persName&gt; to &lt;person&gt;/&lt;persName&gt; to form a\r\nprosopographical base?\r\n\r\n2\\. if you propose person as the element to be used it should\r\nbe of class names as then we need key to identify the\r\nperson.

        "text": "Logged In: YES \nuser\\_id=1148190\n\nLooking at P3, it appears to me that the list of elements within which &lt;text&gt; \r\nis permitted is identical with P4, with the exception of &lt;desc&gt;, &lt;dictscrap&gt;, \r\n&lt;entryfree&gt;, &lt;fDescr&gt;, &lt;fsDescr&gt; \\(permitted contexts in P4 but not P3\\), and \r\n&lt;set&gt; \\(permitted context in P3 but not P4\\), none of which seems relevant \r\nhere. P5 adds &lt;del&gt;, &lt;desc&gt;, &lt;filiation&gt;, &lt;orig&gt;, &lt;restore&gt;, &lt;rhyme&gt;, and \r\nomits a few others, but nothing that is to the point here. So my impression of \r\n&lt;text&gt;'s  permitted locations is apparently accurate as from 1994 through \r\nthe present. \"Allowable between &lt;p&gt;s\" should mean \"allowable as a child of \r\n&lt;div&gt;\" but I don't see that &lt;text&gt; has been allowed as a child of &lt;div&gt; at \r\nany point, including now. \r\n\r\nAdding a type attribute to &lt;text&gt; would help; the most typical use I've seen \r\nhas been to provide a generic taxonomy along the same lines of type on \r\n&lt;div&gt;. The same kinds of values \\(with some obvious omissions and \r\nadditions\\) apply in both cases. Sample values might include \"novel | play | \r\npoem | letter | invoice | receipt | manifest | transcript\" and that sort of thing; \r\nthe reason I'd prefer not to encode these as keywords in the header is that \r\nthey'd be harder to link to specific &lt;text&gt;s. If genre can be expressed at the \r\n&lt;div&gt; level it seems reasonable to be able to express it similarly at the \r\n&lt;text&gt; level, particularly in the case of embedded texts.\r\n\r\nThe real difference between the proposed element \\(which for ease of \r\nreference I'll call &lt;xtext&gt; here\\) and the existing &lt;text&gt; element is that \r\n&lt;text&gt; is usually understood as an independent unit--something that was \r\npublished separately or in some other way has ontological separateness as a \r\nwork. The idea behind &lt;xtext&gt; is that the embedded textual objects don't \r\nnecessarily possess that separateness, and in any case they're not being \r\nrepresented as independent items. They may be quoted material, they may be \r\njust plopped into the narrative \\(for instance, a letter represented within a \r\nnovel but not read aloud within the narrative\\), they may be presented as a \r\nform of exhibit \\(for instance, in 19th-c crime drama, where various kinds of \r\ndocuments are interspersed with narrative commentary as a kind of glue; or \r\nin Renaissance pamphlets ditto\\). The current word for such things is \r\n\"transclusions\" which is dreadfully trendy but does describe the phenomenon \r\nI mean.\r\n\r\nSo on the side of &lt;text&gt; we have:\r\n\\--separately published items \\(e.g. a novel, a poem, a play\\)\r\n\\--sets of items which are explicitly grouped together for publication \\(e.g. a \r\ncollection of novels, plays, etc.\\)\r\n\r\nand on the side of &lt;xtext&gt; we have:\r\n\\--entire textual objects which are quoted within a larger textual context \\(e.g. \r\na one-act play or a short essay quoted within a novel or letter\\)\r\n\\--real or fictional textual objects which are represented within a larger \r\ntextual context \\(e.g. a letter within a novel, a piece of documentary evidence \r\nfrom a witness in a trial proceeding\\)\r\n\r\nA few clarifications in answer to your specific questions:\r\n\r\nThe fact that &lt;xtext&gt; may only occur inside &lt;text&gt; does not cause it to \r\nresemble the &lt;text&gt; within &lt;group&gt; at all;  the &lt;text&gt;s that make up \r\n&lt;group&gt; are tessellating elements \\(within &lt;group&gt;, only &lt;text&gt; is \r\npermitted\\). The idea behind &lt;xtext&gt; is that it is explicitly an embedded \r\nelement: an inclusion like a lump of stone within a conglomerate or a piece of \r\nfruit in a pudding. It is not part of a group, but rather something that appears \r\nwithin some larger stream \\(either by quotation or by inclusion of another \r\nsort, in the manner of a document submitted as evidence in a trial\\). It is not \r\nbeing considered as a published item, although it  may be one; it is not a \r\n\"primary\" document within the textual scheme. It is situated and dependent \r\non its textual context.\r\n\r\nIf both elements were provided, I would advise people to use &lt;text&gt; to \r\nrepresent the boundaries of the primary documents they are dealing with, \r\nwhether those are individual items or groups of items, and to use &lt;xtext&gt; for \r\nall cases where a text-like object \\(i.e. something with a text-like nature and/\r\nor internal structure\\) is embedded within &lt;text&gt;. It would be useful to \r\ndiscuss the difference between embeddedness \\(linked with the idea of \r\n\"floating\"\\) and tesselation; &lt;xtext&gt; is not just another way of doing what \r\n&lt;div&gt; does, which is to represent subdivisions of a document--i.e. the \r\nlogical boundaries of the document's sectioning. It is rather a way of bringing \r\nin things from outside and representing their boundaries and internal \r\nstructure. For instance, in a collected letters volume, I think either &lt;text&gt; or \r\n&lt;div&gt; would be appropriate for the individual letters, but not &lt;xtext&gt;. The \r\nindividual letters are either independent entities or they are subdivisions of \r\nthe whole, but they are not embedded.",

But I believe it would be useful to distinguish \r\nbetween the textual structures which are native to the document's own \r\norganization, and those which come into it from outside, or erupt inside it for \r\nnarrative reasons. Using &lt;text&gt; for the former, and &lt;xtext&gt; for the latter, \r\nwould make it possible to distinguish between the material contained within \r\n&lt;text&gt; elements that are \"native\" in this sense \\(even those which may be \r\ndescendants of the outermost &lt;text&gt; element, such as those enclosed within \r\n&lt;group&gt;\\), and material contained within these \"transcluded\" texts, which has \r\na very different ontological status from that of the surrounding content.",

All the use cases so far presented seem to me to indicate that there is a need for some kind of \"floating\" text container, and I don't disagree with that. But I believe that we already have two elements fit for this purpose in &lt;text&gt; \\(where the floating object is actually a component of the current text but doesn't respect the usual hierarchic structure\\) and &lt;quote&gt; \\(where the floating object is in a sense not a component of the current text, being quoted from some other source\\). If there are limitations in the content models of the existing elements, by all means let's fix them; I've started to explore that possibility with &lt;quote&gt; below. But to add a third element into this already rather crowded corner of the Guidelines really needs some substantial examples where the existing two are not good enough. Which is not of course to say that such cases don't exist. I just haven't seen any yet and don't have the leisure to speculate. \r\n\r\nAnother way of looking at this argument is that really the desire here is to restrict the meaning of &lt;text&gt; to \"the outermost element of a hierarchically structured document\" and invent &lt;floatingText&gt; for the other cases. But then would the &lt;text&gt;s which make up a &lt;group&gt; become &lt;floatingText&gt;s ? I hope not.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

However, I agree that  it is probably a good idea to distinguish the use of &lt;text&gt; as a container, either directly within  &lt;TEI&gt; or within &lt;group&gt;, on the one hand, from its use a free standing embedded object on the other, and am also reconciled to the fact that some at least of the latter uses are not best served by &lt;quote&gt;. So I am closing this ticket and creating a new TRAC item to produce and circulate a document defining a new &lt;floatingText&gt; element asap, with a view to getting it into P5 if there is general agreement.

        "text": "Logged In: YES \nuser\\_id=686243\nOriginator: NO\n\nThis request comprises two separate issues,\r\nwhich I will address separately.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe writing= attribute of &lt;hand&gt; \\(and also\r\n&lt;handShift&gt;\\) is currently declared as datatype\r\ndata.enumerated, which limits it to a single\r\nvalue. This is insufficient. However, data.words\r\nwould not permit the capability to restrict the\r\nvalue\\(s\\) to those in a list of documented\r\npossibilities. Currently only data.code and\r\ndata.enumerated provide this highly desirable\r\ncapability.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is no theorhetical reason not to\r\nhave a datatype in which multiple choices from a\r\nlist of documented possibilities. I.e., to have\r\neither a data.codes or a data.enumerateds.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, for Relax NG \\(and I believe W3C\r\nSchema\\) users, there is no reason the schema\r\ncould not permit multiple values while\r\nsimultaneously enforcing that those values come\r\nfrom the previously declared list. \\(DTD users\r\nwill not have this advantage.\\)\r\n\r\nSo, after some quick discussions, we have\r\nimplemented a quick although not ideal mechanism\r\nfor handling this: a new datatype that is the\r\nequivalent of \"data.enumerateds\". However, since\r\n\"enumerateds\" is not only not a word, it isn't\r\nclear, the names have been changed to\r\n\"data.selection\" and \"data.selections\". \\(These\r\nnames have not been approved by Council yet, and\r\nare subject to change.\\)\r\n\r\nThe current mechanism consists of a new\r\nrepeatable= attribute on &lt;valList&gt;. This does\r\nwork, and a new version of P5 that makes use of\r\nit has been checked into a development branch on\r\nSourceforge \\(called \"P5-selections\"\\). However,\r\nthis is not the best way to achieve this effect.\r\nA better solution would be to specify the\r\nrepeatability of the tokens in an attribute\r\nvalue on the &lt;datatype&gt; itself.\r\n\r\nI am very hopeful that, perhaps even within the\r\nnext few days, such a mechanism can be hammered\r\nout and implemented in P5. However, if it cannot\r\nbe, at least the original poster's desired\r\nresult -- being able to specify more than one\r\nvalue for writing= of &lt;hand&gt; \\(and of\r\n&lt;handShift&gt;\\) will be met.\r\n\r\nTherefore, even though the feature is not merged\r\ninto the trunk development branch pending what\r\nmechanism to use, I am closing this part of the\r\nfeature request.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second part of this feature request is a\r\nsuggestion that perhaps the ink= attribute of\r\n&lt;hand&gt; \\(and of &lt;handShift&gt;, and arguably the\r\nmedium= attribute of &lt;handNote&gt;\\) should be of\r\ndatatype data.selection, rather than data.code.\r\n\\(The difference is primarily where the\r\ndocumented list of possible values resides -- in\r\nthe former case it is inthe schema, in the\r\nlatter it is in an XML document, typically but\r\nnot necessarily the header of the document that\r\ncontains the data.code attribute.\\)\r\n\r\nAfter speaking to the original poster, it\r\nbecomes clear that her preference would be, in\r\norder:\r\n\r\n\\* data.code, with a defined place in the TEI\r\nHeader for the codes to be declared, e.g. an\r\n&lt;inkList&gt;\r\n\\* data.selection\r\n\\* data.name\r\n\\* data.word\r\n\r\nand I completely agree. However, it seems very\r\nunlikely that we have the time at the moment to\r\ncreate, flesh out, agree upon, and implement a\r\nproposal for a specific place in the TEI Header\r\nto list possible values of this attribute in\r\ntime for the scheduled 1.0 release.\r\n\r\nTherefore I have chosen my \\(and the original\r\nposter's\\) second choice, and changed ink=\r\nattribute of &lt;hand&gt; and &lt;handShift&gt;, and the\r\nmedium= attribute of &lt;handNote&gt; to\r\ndata.enumerated \\(in the trunk\\) and to\r\ndata.selection \\(in the new branch\\).\r\n",

There is some\r\ndiscussion at 6.5.5 and 18.1.2. This is needed as many\r\npeople wish to indicate just those letters which have\r\nbeen supplied.  \r\n\r\nPreviously on TEI-L, I believe &lt;hi&gt; has been suggested\r\nfor this use, but this is semantically wrong since it\r\nis not highlighted text in the original.  The use of\r\n&lt;seg&gt; is a possibility, but a bulky one.  &lt;supplied&gt; is\r\nclearly wrong because of its definition \\(though that\r\ncould be changed\\).\r\n\r\nOne possibility is to use a nested &lt;expan&gt;.  Since\r\n&lt;expan&gt; is defined as containing \"the expansion of an\r\nabbreviation\", this is arguably correct.  Though, I\r\nbelieve it has been suggested previously that this\r\nshould only be used for the expansion as a whole.  But\r\nif we did that it would mean something like this:\r\n\r\n&lt;choice&gt;\r\n&lt;abbr&gt;dni&lt;/abbr&gt;\r\n&lt;expan&gt;d&lt;expan&gt;omi&lt;/expan&gt;ni&lt;/expan&gt;\r\n&lt;/choice&gt;\r\n\r\nThough I don't really like that, I prefer it to using\r\n&lt;seg&gt;:\r\n\r\n&lt;choice&gt;\r\n&lt;abbr&gt;dni&lt;/abbr&gt;\r\n&lt;expan&gt;d&lt;seg type=\"expansion\"&gt;omi&lt;/seg&gt;ni&lt;/expan&gt;\r\n&lt;/choice&gt;\r\n\r\nWhat about the possibility of a new element existing\r\nsolely as a child of &lt;expan&gt; to indicate the individual\r\nexpanded letters of an abbreviation.  For example: \r\n\r\n&lt;choice&gt;\r\n&lt;abbr&gt;dni&lt;/abbr&gt;\r\n&lt;expan&gt;d&lt;e&gt;omi&lt;/e&gt;ni&lt;/expan&gt;\r\n&lt;/choice&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n-James",

This datatype permits a string that matches\r\nany of the W3C Schema date & time datatypes, OR a\r\nstring matching that long-winded pattern.\r\n\r\nThat pattern exists solely to permit times to be\r\nrecorded without minutes or seconds. The W3C datatypes\r\nrequire that minutes and seconds be specified, but the\r\nTEI datatype does not. The pattern is the portion of\r\nthe datatype that permits times \\(or dateTimes\\) without\r\nminutes or seconds.\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt; Question 1: Is it a typo or what is the reason to\r\n&gt; make \"T\" mandatory for dates \\(or do I read the\r\n&gt; pattern wrongly\\)?\r\n\r\nNot a typo. The pattern does not match dates \\(which are\r\nmatched by xsd:date instead\\), but rather only matches\r\ntimes with reduced precision or dateTimes with reduced\r\nprecision.\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt; Question 2: Is the year 0 allowed to be able to tag\r\n&gt; dates as proposed by ISO 8601?\r\n\r\nNo. Per \\_XML Schema Part 2: Datatypes Second Edition\\_\r\nappendix D.3.2: 'The year \"0000\" is an illegal year value.'\r\nHowever, it is expected this will be corrected someday. See\r\nhttp://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-xmlschema-2-20041028/\\#year-zero.\r\nThat note states that 8601:2000 permits 0000, but it was\r\npublished too late to be included. Note that 8601:2004 also\r\npermits 0000.\r\n\r\nHowever, you have correctly noticed that the TEI\r\npattern for representation of a dateTime with reduced\r\nprecision \\*does\\* permit \"0000\". This, it seems to me,\r\nis an error \\(on my part\\).\r\n\r\nIf there is demand for use of \"0000\", TEI would be\r\nhappy to consider including it in the TEI datatype.\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt; Question 3: What is the reason not to allow month or\r\n&gt; day 00 \\(eg if it was not known\\)?\r\n\r\nGood question. The answer is pretty simple, if a bit of\r\na cop-out: because neither ISO nor W3C permits it.\r\n\\(Although the W3C specification does seem to leave\r\nwiggle room.\\) However it is a bit odd to know the year\r\nand the hour, but not the month or day. But in such a\r\npeculiar circumstance, you are right, the regularized\r\nform TEI recommends cannot be used to record that\r\ninformation. \\(Separate use of the &lt;year&gt; and &lt;hour&gt;\r\nelements might be put to the task.\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt; Question 4: Why are only years allowed in the range\r\n&gt; -9999 to 9999?\r\n\r\nValues outside the range -9999 to 9999 \\*are\\* allowed\r\nfor in the representation of a date, year, year &\r\nmonth, or date & time. But you are right, years outside\r\nthat range are not permitted in the representation of a\r\ndate & time with reduced precision. Perhaps just an\r\noversight on my part, or perhaps it was felt that no\r\none would want to represent a point in time that far\r\naway down to the hour, but not to the second. Again, if\r\nthere is demand for this, TEI would be happy to\r\nconsider including it in the TEI datatype.\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt; If I want to use dates from the Stone Age to the far\r\n&gt; future ...\r\n\r\nYou would be relying on the xsd:date datatype, and\r\nwhatever the TEI does with its pattern for reduced\r\nprecision would not affect you. If you wanted to\r\nrepresent dates & times with reduced precision from the\r\nstone age or the far future, you would be very\r\nfrustrated that the TEI limits you to 4 digits for the\r\nyear, and would submit a bug report. :-\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt; ... a pattern like\r\n&gt;\r\n-?\\(\\[0\\]\\{4\\}|\\[0-9\\]\\{0-3\\}\\[1-9\\]\\[0-9\\]\\*\\)-\\(0\\[0-9\\]|1\\[0-2\\]\\)-\\(0\\[0-9\\]|\\[12\\]\\[0-9\\]|3\\[01\\]\\)\r\n&gt; for the date part seems to be more appropriate: For\r\n&gt; unknown year, month or day 0000 or 00; no mandatory\r\n&gt; time zone. ... Is there anything wrong with my\r\n&gt; pattern?\r\n\r\nFirst, note that the timezone is not mandatory in the\r\nTEI pattern for representation of times with reduced\r\nprecision or dateTimes with reduced precision.\r\n\r\nAs for the semantics of the pattern, I think use of\r\n\"0000\" for an unknown year is a very bad idea, in light\r\nof the W3C intention to follow ISO 8601 and permit it\r\nfor representation of the year 1 BCE.\r\n\r\nThe use of \"00\" for an unknown month or day is not\r\nnecessarily a bad idea on its own, but the fact that is\r\nnot permitted in ISO 8601 nor W3C makes me think TEI\r\nshould not do that either.\r\n\r\nAs for the pattern itself, I'm not sure why limit the 0\r\nversion of the year to four digits.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am inclined to say that either \r\n\r\na\\) the TEI pattern for reduced precisions should match\r\nthe W3C datatypes and not permit the year \"0\" \\(until\r\nsuch time as the W3C datatypes permit \"0\", and then\r\nthey should\\); OR\r\n\r\nb\\) the TEI data.temporal datatype should side with ISO\r\n\\(breaking with W3C until they catch up per their\r\nnote\\) and permit the year \"0\", whether with reduced\r\nprecision or not.\r\n",

A review of the CIDOC\r\nConceptual Reference Model class hierarchy \\(see\r\nhttp://cidoc.ics.forth.gr/definition\\_cidoc.html\\)\r\nsuggests something like this would be a good\r\nstarting-point:\r\n\r\nPeriod\r\n\\- Event\r\n\\- - Activity\r\nObject\r\nActor\r\n\\- Group\r\n\\- Person  \r\nTime-span\r\nPlace\r\nDimension\r\n\r\n\\(Indentation indicates superclass-subclass\r\nrelationships between element types.\\)  I have omitted\r\nthe \"appellation\" part of the framework, on the grounds\r\nthat the names of these entities will be recorded as\r\nsubelements, as at present.\r\n\r\nThe CIDOC CRM properties could be represented by\r\ngeneric \"role\" and/or \"type\" attributes, whose values\r\ncould be constrained for particular applications.\r\n\r\nI think that most requirements could be met by using\r\nperiod/event/activity as a group element, holding the\r\nparties involved in that episode as subelements.  This\r\nis very much how persEvent is currently used.\r\n\r\nIt must be possible to encode this information\r\nout-of-line as well as inline, since the source text\r\nmay not allow a single element to neatly group all the\r\nelements of an assertion.\r\n",

  "description": "On behalf of textual editors who need to link textual\r\ncomponents -- e.g., letters or even strokes as well as\r\nmarginalia, erasures, damage, superscripts,\r\nilluminations, etc. -- to the occurrence of these\r\ncomponents in a digital facsimile of the text \\(e.g., a\r\nmonograph page, a manuscript folio, a cuneiform tablet,\r\na papyrus scroll\\), I propose a new global attribute\r\nnamed @coord.

Sorry for the delay, and thanks to the\r\nSF-robot for reminding me. :-\\)\r\n\r\nI may be misinterpreting the semantics of\r\n&lt;catRef&gt; and &lt;category&gt;, in which case\r\nenlightenment appreciated.\r\n\r\n\"The &lt;catRef&gt; element categorizes an individual\r\ntext \u2026 The &lt;category&gt; element \u2026 holds\r\ninformation about a particular classification or\r\ncategory within a given taxonomy\" \\[3.4.3\\] We'd\r\nlike to be able to classify the categorization\r\nof a text, not a particular classification.\r\n\r\nE.g., Suppose we have the following classification scheme.\r\n\r\n&lt;taxonomy&gt;\r\n&lt;\\!-- ... --&gt;\r\n&lt;category&gt;\r\n&lt;catDesc&gt;needlework&lt;/catDesc&gt;\r\n&lt;category xml:id=\"knit\"&gt;&lt;catDesc&gt;knitting&lt;/catDesc&gt;&lt;/category&gt;\r\n&lt;category&gt;&lt;catDesc&gt;crochet&lt;/catDesc&gt;&lt;/category&gt;\r\n&lt;category&gt;&lt;catDesc&gt;weaving&lt;/catDesc&gt;&lt;/category&gt;\r\n&lt;category&gt;&lt;catDesc&gt;sewing&lt;/catDesc&gt;&lt;/category&gt;\r\n&lt;/category&gt;\r\n&lt;\\!-- ... --&gt;\r\n&lt;category&gt;\r\n&lt;catDesc&gt;ships&lt;/catDesc&gt;\r\n&lt;category xml:id=\"sail\"&gt;&lt;catDesc&gt;sailing&lt;/catDesc&gt;&lt;/category&gt;\r\n&lt;category&gt;&lt;catDesc&gt;steam-powered&lt;/catDesc&gt;&lt;/category&gt;\r\n&lt;category&gt;&lt;catDesc&gt;nuclear-powered&lt;/catDesc&gt;&lt;/category&gt;\r\n&lt;/category&gt;\r\n&lt;\\!-- ... --&gt;\r\n&lt;/taxonomy&gt;\r\n\r\nNow suppose we have a text we're encoding that\r\nwe'd like to classify. It is primarily about\r\nknitting, but \\(by way of pointing out there are\r\nsome things which really can't be knit, of which\r\na mainsail is one\\) the author takes a lovely\r\nchapter-long tangent discussing sailing ships.\r\nThis tangent, in fact, is so interesting it has\r\nbeen quoted several times in the sailing\r\nliterature. So we really can't ignore it, but we\r\ndon't want to give the impression this book is\r\n\\*about\\* sailing, because it is primarily about\r\nknitting.\r\n\r\nThe method that jumps to mind to encode this is\r\n\r\n&lt;textClass&gt;\r\n&lt;catRef type=\"main\" target=\"\\#knit\"/&gt;\r\n&lt;catRef type=\"subordinate\" target=\"\\#sail\"/&gt;\r\n&lt;/textClass&gt;\r\n\r\nCertainly it is not the case that, in general,\r\nsailing is subordinate to knitting. In fact you\r\nmay well have a different text that is primarily\r\nabout sailing, but \\(by way of discussing ways\r\nsailors should pass the time on long voyages\\)\r\nhas a lovely chapter about knitting\\!\r\n\r\nSo I think this \"how relevant is this\r\nclassification to this text\" feature is squarely\r\na feature of &lt;catRef&gt;, not of &lt;category&gt;.\r\n\r\nBut we could also ask \"why does &lt;catRef&gt; has a\r\ntarget= of its own, rather than inheriting it\r\nthrough att.pointing, in which case it would\r\nhave a type= attribute\\!\"\r\n\r\nHowever, the type= attribute provided by the\r\nclass att.pointing \"should indicate the intended\r\nfunction of the pointer, or the rhetorical\r\nrelationship between its source and target.\"\r\n\\[tagdoc\\] Thus while it does not strictly\r\ndescribe the type of pointer \\(absolute URL,\r\nrelative IRI, IDREF, etc\\), I can see that its\r\nsemantics don't precisely line up with\r\ndescribing the type of categorization, either.\r\n\r\nSo at the moment I don't have a definitive idea\r\non how to do so, but it seems clear to me that\r\nit is a good idea to be able to categorize a\r\n&lt;catRef&gt;'s \\*classification\\* function \\(as opposed\r\nto its \\*pointer\\*\\) according to any convenient\r\ntypology.\r\n",

For reasons already\r\ndiscussed on-list, I would make the following two\r\nrecommendations \\(to be considered independently\\):\r\n\r\n\\(1\\) allow the element &lt;note&gt; to appear immediately\r\ninside &lt;app&gt;, as well as within &lt;lem&gt; and &lt;rdg&gt; as\r\ncurrently;\r\n\r\n\\(2\\) make &lt;rdg&gt; within &lt;app&gt; optional rather than\r\nrequired, so that an &lt;app&gt; could contain, for example,\r\njust a &lt;lem&gt;, or even \\(more radically\\) just a &lt;note&gt;.\r\n\r\nAm willing to return to this discussion privately or on\r\nTEI-L if necessary.",

In the latter disciplines it is not uncommon to have an apparatus below the text--as in ms editions--but this apparatus will tend to contain different restorations and interpretations of a single text rather than MS variants. Sometimes an entry such as \"l. 3, \\_editiones\\_, Bernard; \\_editionum\\_, P & H\" might appear alongside one such as \"l. 4, \\_ab.\\[...\\_, the final letter might be o or e\", or even a comment such as \"The final letters of every line are very badly worn.\"\r\n\r\nOf course the use of &lt;app&gt; within a text to record variant readings is not affected by this argument, but the use of &lt;app&gt; to list variants and notes in an \"apparatus\" at the end of the text, marked-up externally, I believe is.

We already do have a whole set of tags for transcription of primary sources.  What seems to be amiss is a way to gather them together in one place as \"apparatus\".

Others are very similar kinds of comment or remark, just happening not to involve variants. All I am suggesting is that we make the content model a tiny bit less strict, to make &lt;rdg&gt; optional rather than required.  99% of such items include at least one reading or lemma; it seems cumbersome to have to use a different element \\(what, &lt;note&gt;?\\) for those few that do not.

Personally, I'd prefer to see the place= attribute\r\ndropped \\(expecting users to wrap such information into\r\nrend=\\) for now, and tackle rendition \\(including placement,\r\nrotation, curve of baseline, etc., as well as the usual\r\ntypeface, fontsize, indentation, etc.\\) with a full workgroup\r\nsometime in the future.\r\n\r\nIf we do adopt rotate= \\(which might be better called angle=\r\nor rotation=\\), I am in favor of including the direction so\r\nthat we do not need a second attribute to indicate CW or\r\nCCW. However, do we want to insist people use degrees?\r\nWouldn't some people prefer grads, radians, or revs?",

  "description": "\r\nAs I recently discovered, somewhere along the road to P5, we lost the ability to indicate the writing direction of a document.  This used to be part of the WSD in P4 and we still can have the \\(default\\) direction on individual characters via their Unicode properties in P5, but there seems to be no way to indicate this with markup on other levels. One could conceive this as a job for the @rend but than we are out in the open wilderness that reigns there.\r\n\r\nNow what to do? I am inclined to propose an attribute that could either be part of model.global by default or be selected independently \\(or maybe part of the gaiji module?, but in reality, this is quite a separate question\\).\r\n\r\nHTML 4.01, btw does define this as follows:\r\n\r\ndir    \\(ltr|rtl\\)  \\#IMPLIED  -- default directionality --\r\n\r\n\\(see http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/dirlang.html\\)\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, we should also account for indicating how the sequence of lines proceed on the page, which is separate from the text direction indicated by @dir, but could use the same set of possible attribute values, \r\ne.g. \r\nltr = left to right\r\nrtl = right to left\r\nttb = top to bottom\r\nbtt = bottom to top \\(dont know of a sample, but just for completeness\\)\r\n\r\nMaybe one could combine these values, so that no additional attribute is needed beside @dir,\r\ne.g.\r\n&lt;p dir=\"ltr.ttb\"&gt;This paragraph is written from left to right and the lines proceed from top to bottom, as is normal for modern western writing&lt;/p&gt;.\r\n\r\nOne last problem is the Boustrophedon. From the Unicode glossary \\(http://unicode.org/glossary/\\):\r\n&lt;q&gt;\r\nBoustrophedon.A pattern of writing seen in some ancient manuscripts and inscriptions, where alternate lines of text are laid out in opposite directions, and where right-to-left lines generally use glyphs mirrored from their left-to-right forms. Literally, \u201cas the ox turns,\u201d referring to the plowing of a field.\r\n&lt;/q&gt;\r\nHow do we handle this?\r\n\r\n\\---\r\nNeedless to say that I would rather see this in P5, since it would be a bit embarassing to come out of the woods with so little of the homework done.\r\n\r\nChristian \r\n\r\n",

  "description": "I'd like to propose a slight refinement to the way imprecise numerical values \\(e.g. dates, measurements, extents of gap or space, etc.\\) are expressed. In general terms, the distinction I would like to see enabled \\(even recommended\\) would be that between the expressions:\r\n\r\n\\(a\\) \"Date: c. A.D. 250\"\r\n\\(b\\) \"Date: A.D. 250?\"\r\n\r\nThe former is an expression of imprecision; the editor is fairly confident that the object or event she is dating happened pretty close to the middle of the third century, but isn't going to commit to that precise year. The latter is an expression of uncertainty; the editor may have evidence that the event occured in precisely that year, but is not entirely happy with her interpretation of the evidence. They are not the same thing. \\(In the sciences there is often this same distinction between precision and accuracy, for example.\\)\r\n\r\nNow I see that in &lt;date&gt; there is already a precision attribute for this purpose, but I would like to see this extended to elements such as &lt;gap&gt; and &lt;space&gt; \\(where it would refer to the precision of @extent\\), and &lt;measure&gt; \\(where it would modify @value\\). This has been the practice of the EpiDoc Guidelines for a while now, since we believe the certainty mechanism is inadequate \\(and in any case inaccurate\\) for this purpose.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n\"H. c. 0.50\" could be represented:\r\n&lt;measure type=\"length\" dim=\"height\" precision=\"low\" value=\"0.50\"&gt;\r\n\r\n\"\\[ . . c. 12 . . \\]\" would be:\r\n&lt;gap reason=\"lost\" extent=\"12\" precision=\"low\"/&gt;\r\n\r\nThis would involve simply the addition of an attribute to the model of these elements and so would be fully backward-compatible with earlier versions of P5.\r\n\r\n\\(I'm also going to float this for discussion on the list, because I think it's an important concept worth getting people's opinions on.\\)",

  "description": "From the \"should have remembered this months ago\" department \u2026\r\n\r\nBack in August of 1999, I added a type= attribute to the &lt;tag&gt; element for the Women Writers Project. The declaration would the following in RELAX NG.\r\n\r\nattribute type \\{ \"start\" | \"empty\" | \"end\" \\}\r\n\r\nIn truth, if we really wanted an element for describing markup constructs in an XML instance, we would have something more like\r\n\r\nelement markup \\{\r\nattribute type \\{ \"start\" | \"empty\" | \"end\" |\r\n\"pi\" | \"comment\" | \"ms\" \\},\r\n\r\nor go whole-hog and use constructs similar to &lt;xsl:element&gt;, etc.\r\n\r\nBut those ideas are overkill. But having a type= on &lt;tag&gt; allows the element to be more consistent. As it is now, one transcribes some of the characters that delimit the tag in the source as content, and some are subsumed by the &lt;tag&gt; element, as in the example in the tagdoc:\r\n\r\nMark the start of each italicised phrase with a\r\n&lt;tag&gt;hi rend=\"it\"&lt;/tag&gt; tag, and its end with a\r\n&lt;tag&gt;/hi&lt;/tag&gt; tag.\r\n\r\nUsing type= would allow all the tag delimiting characters to be represented by markup:\r\n\r\nMark the start of each italicised phrase with a\r\n&lt;tag type=\"start&gt;hi rend=\"it\"&lt;/tag&gt; tag, and its\r\nend with a &lt;tag type=\"end\"&gt;hi&lt;/tag&gt; tag.\r\n",

  "description": "The following relates to what started me reading the guidelines--trying to be able to follow the discussions so as to try to solve the few problems we have in getting our formerly P4 documents to validate. The following are the only essential barriers we have, and I wonder whether this might also be an issue for others too possibly. I have some more ideas such as those shared during the course of discussing the documentation, but which I plan on holding of on submitting \\(if you even would like ideas which are not immediately needed\\) since it is only this request which is essential for us.\\)\r\n\r\n1\\) In closer \\(via divBottom?\\):  figure, bibl, meeting\r\n2\\) In byline \\(via titlepagePart, pLike.front, divTop, divBottom, or divWrapper?\\): figure, bibl, meeting\r\n3\\) In docTitle \\(via titlepagePart, pLike.front?\\): figure\r\n4\\) In bibl \\(via inter?\\): figure\r\n5\\) In opener \\(via divTop?\\): meeting\r\n6\\) Allow &lt;figure&gt; after a closer \\(as in a div3\\)  \\(via divBottom or global?\\)\r\n\r\nWe'd also like to see &lt;meeting&gt; in running prose \\(where I think &lt;event&gt; would also be useful\\). The requests for &lt;meeting&gt;, however, are not as critical for us, since we can use &lt;name&gt; if necessary, but those pertaining to the placement of &lt;figure&gt; and &lt;bibl&gt; are.\r\n\r\nWould adding &lt;meeting&gt; and/or model.biblLike \\(bibl\\) to model.phrase, and/or changing model.inter to work inside of divBottom/divTop/global/pLike.front work? Sorry, I still have little understanding of the class system, but just wanted to offer something.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if there any other details I should supply.\r\n\r\nBrett\r\n",

Is it true you could validly do the things you ask for in P4?\r\n\r\nCould you mail me a number of examples, perhaps including page images, that show the things that you need?

It seems P5 made a div that contains first a div, then a figure invalid. Raised that matter on the council mailing list \\(http://lists.village.virginia.edu/pipermail/tei-council/2008/009823.html\\)\r\n\r\n2\\. A bibl can 'accidentally' be interrupted by a picture, e.g. in the case of an inserted page with images. Raised the matter of how to deal with that situation on TEI-L \\(http://listserv.brown.edu/archives/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0807&L=TEI-L&T=0&F=&S=&P=401\\)\r\n\r\n3\\. Some of the other issues result from complex postscripts \\(that actually include another letter\\). Referring to issue 1928212 \\(Make postscript more div-like\\) it seems best to encode the postscript in these cases as a separate div. The new correspondence SIG will definitely need to have another look at letter-like poststcripts.\r\n",

The figure inside the bibl is not \\*part\\* of the bibl, any more than the &lt;pb/&gt; is, so it would actually be wrong to permit within its content model. My prefered solution would be to put the &lt;figure&gt; after the &lt;bibl&gt;, and indicate its position inside the &lt;bibl&gt; by means of a &lt;ptr&gt;. \r\n\r\nThe third point, I think, is closed: divLike postscripts should be tagged as &lt;div type=\"postscript\"&gt;\r\n",

The members of divBottom must be disjoint with the members of model.common \\(which -- via model.inter -- includes figure\\). Otherwise the content model of &lt;div&gt; becomes ambiguous. As Sebastian notes, you can put &lt;figure&gt; inside &lt;epigraph&gt;, since that has a richer content model, but all the other divBottom elements only permit phrase level elements as content: so you could put a &lt;graphic&gt; inside one of them -- which might make better sense.  In general &lt;graphic&gt;, as a member of model.phrase, is available in most of the places you mention above. \r\n",

I have a question about the &lt;sp&gt; element and wonder why it cannot  \r\ndirectly contain &lt;q&gt;, &lt;quote&gt;, or &lt;floatingText&gt; elements.  The major  \r\nuse of the &lt;sp&gt; element, I assume, is to enclose utterances by  \r\nspeakers in plays. So a play is articulated into acts, scenes, and  \r\nspeeches. Here is an example from Cymbeline:\r\n\r\nSoothsayer \\[reads\\] When as a lion's whelp . . . . flourish in peace  \r\nand plenty\r\n\r\nThou, Leonatus, art the lion's whelp\r\nThe fit and apt construction of thy name\r\n\r\nSo we have a speaker label, a stage direction, a reading of an  \r\n\"external\" document in prose, followed by the Soothsayer's comments in  \r\nverse.\r\n\r\nThis could be represented as\r\n\r\n&lt;sp&gt;&lt;speaker&gt;Soothsayer&lt;/speaker&gt;\r\n&lt;stage&gt; reads&lt;/stage&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;floatingText&gt;&lt;body&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;When as a lion's whelp . . . . flourish in peace and plenty&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/floatingText&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;l&gt;Thou Leonatus, ar the lion's whelp&lt;/l&gt;\r\n&lt;l&gt;The fit and apt construction of thy name&lt;/l&gt;\r\n&lt;/sp&gt;\r\n\r\nPerhaps &lt;floatingText&gt; is too heavy artillery for a very short, though  \r\ncomplete, document,  and just &lt;quote&gt; or &lt;quote type=\"oracle\"&gt; would  \r\ndo.  But why not admit\r\n\r\n&lt;sp&gt;&lt;speaker&gt;Soothsayer&lt;/speaker&gt;\r\n&lt;stage&gt; reads&lt;/stage&gt;\r\n&lt;quote&gt;When as a lion's whelp . . . . flourish in peace and plenty&lt;/ \r\nquote&gt;\r\n&lt;l&gt;Thou Leonatus, art the lion's whelp&lt;/l&gt;\r\n&lt;l&gt;The fit and apt construction of thy name&lt;/l&gt;\r\n&lt;/sp&gt;\r\n\r\nIt is a flatter structure than\r\n\r\n&lt;sp&gt;&lt;speaker&gt;Soothsayer&lt;/speaker&gt;\r\n&lt;stage&gt; reads&lt;/stage&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;When as a lion's whelp . . . . flourish in peace and plenty&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;l&gt;Thou Leonatus, ar the lion's whelp&lt;/l&gt;\r\n&lt;l&gt;The fit and apt construction of thy name&lt;/l&gt;\r\n\r\nand other things being equal, flatter is better.",

So the essential question is, how do we add the @precision and related attributes to 'gap', 'space', 'date', 'measure', 'num', and various dimensions elements? \\(What others need @precision?\\) Surely any element in att.editLike that needs @precision also needs the other att.dimensions attributes--since precision only has any meaning if applied unambiguously to a quantity--so @precision shouldn't be in att.editLike in the first place. \\(If for some reason you want to apply precision to 'supplied', for example, you should use the new 'precision' element to do so.\\)",

  "description": "\\[posted at the request of Martin Mueller, who is \r\nstruggling with the incompatabilities between\r\nthe TCP postscript element and the similar element\r\nadopted later in P5. The language below is mine, not\r\nhis. -- pfs.\\]\r\n\r\nThough it is good to have a postscript tag in P5, the\r\npresent definition is difficult to apply to a large\r\nnumber of actual postscripts. Many, perhaps most,\r\npostscripts have their own openers and/or closers, for\r\nexample \\(datelines and signatures especially\\); many \r\nhave heads \\(or at least headings that are very similar\r\nto the things that we call heads in the case of the\r\nargument element\\); and a few may even contain internal\r\ndivisions of a div-like character.\r\n\r\nLess critically, the placement of the P5 postscript\r\nelement among the div-bottom tags, instead of \r\nwithin closer, often forces a somewhat artificial\r\nclosing of one closer and reopening of another \r\nin order to allow postscript to fall between them.\r\n\r\n\\[pfs: I would add that forcing typical epistolary\r\nfeatures into TEI tags is not infrequently difficult,\r\nespecially enclosures, endorsements, seals,\r\ndirections, and notarization statements. Enclosures\r\ncan usu. be handled by floatText \\(or equivalent\r\nq/text/body/div\\) within postscript, though that may\r\nbe abusive, but the others are difficult to handle\r\nat all satisfactorily. The TCP tag to which Martin\r\nis comparing P5's postscript is defined as follows,\r\nlargely on the basis of 'literary warrant'  -- i.e.,\r\ntables are not allowed simply because none have\r\nbeen encountered yet\\):\r\n\r\n&lt;\\!ELEMENT postscript \r\n\\(\\(head | opener | lb | milestone | pb | gap\\)\\*,\r\n\\(\\(p | l | lg | q | list | letter | note | stage | sp | bibl\\), \r\n\\(lb | milestone | pb | gap\\)\\*\\)+,\r\n\\(\\(closer | tailnote | trailer\\), \\(lb | milestone | pb | gap\\)\\*\\)\\*\\)  &gt;\r\n\r\n\\(For 'letter' read floatText \\(or floatDiv\\!\\); for\r\n'q' read 'quote' \\(as in P3 TEI lite\\)\\).\r\n\r\nTCP's tag is currently allowed only within closer. \r\n\r\nWe haven't really worked out a satisfactory way to tag the other epistolary difficulties.\\]\r\n\r\n",

It is very common to find a letter composed over the course of two or more days, often divided by the author into sub-letters with separate datelines, and such letters would naturally be tagged using separate &lt;div&gt; or &lt;divN&gt; elements. It seems to me that the purpose of a separate postscript tag is really to handle formulaic postscripts \\(\"P.S. I love you\\!\"\\) rather than complexly structured additions that just happen to follow a signature. ",

        "text": "1\\. split @min @max @atLeast @atMost out of att.dimensions into new class att.ranging; made att.dimensions member of this new class\r\n2\\. Realized that @locus was seriously broken at P5, so posted the following set of proposals to Council for approval:\r\n\r\nThe &lt;certainty&gt; element has an attribute @locus, which Gabriel wants to \r\nuse to supply the name of an attribute, the value of which he wants to \r\nindicate uncertainty \\(or imprecision\\) about.\r\n\r\nIn P3 and P4, this attribute had a range of values which included both \r\nattribute names and some specific literals \\(e.g. you could say things \r\nlike @locus=\"\\#gi\" to indicate uncertainty about whether this is the \r\nright tag, or @locus=\"\\#transcribedContent\" for uncertainty about the \r\ncontent of the element, or @locus=\"\\#location\" if you felt the start or \r\nend tags might not be in the right place\\). At P5, someone \\(probably me\\) \r\nrealised that it was too hard to define a datatype for the attribute \r\n@locus, which would allow both a closed set of literals beginning with \r\nsharp signs, and an arbitrary collection of attribute names. P5 \r\ntherefore has as possible values a set of literals, including \"attrName\" \r\nalong with the old values, minus their sharps. There is also a rather \r\nvague statement \"if the name of an attribute is supplied it must be \r\nprefixed by \"att.\" Clearly this cannot work.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the locus, there is a @target attribute which is used to \r\npoint to the element/s in the document about which uncertainty or \r\nimprecision is being asserted. Like others such, this attribute is a \r\ndata.pointer, so it could in principle contain an xpath, wrapped up in \r\nan xpointer, using the rather verbose xpath1 syntax discussed in 16.2.4 \r\n\\-- e.g. to point to the attribute @foo on the element with xml:id=\"bar\" \r\nyou'd have to say @target='\\#xpath1\\(//\\*\\[xml:id=\"bar\"\\]/@foo' vel sim. \r\nThat's OK on paper, but we don't know of any systems that implement it; \r\nin particular Oxygen doesn't.\r\n\r\nWe note however that there's no good reason why making an assertion \r\nabout a specific attribute \\(or, more interestingly, a group of \r\nattributes\\) should be handled differently from making one about a \r\nspecific element \\(or group thereof\\). And clearly xpath is the right \r\nsyntax for the job. And xpath processors definitely exist\\! But using \r\nxpointer in this way seems hopelessly complex...\r\n\r\nFurther, we note that having @locus indicate things at two completely \r\ndifferent levels of abstraction is confusing; and that the old method, \r\neven if it worked, didn't allow you to distinguish uncertainty about the \r\nappropriateness of the attribute \\*name\\* from uncertainty about its \\*value\\*.\r\n\r\nCONSEQUENTLY after much furrowing of brows, the Oxford team would like \r\nto propose the following set of changes, applicable to both the existing \r\n&lt;certainty&gt; and the newly proposed &lt;precision&gt; element\r\n\r\n1\\. The valList for @locus should permit only the following\r\n\"name\", \"value\", \"startLoc\", \"endLoc\", \"location\"\r\n\r\n\\(we might say that if this is not specified, \"value\" should be assumed\\)\r\n\r\n2\\. An additional attribute @path should be defined. The value of this is \r\nan xpath2 expression, which should be understood relative to the value \r\nof @target, which remains as at present a data pointer giving the \r\ncontext within which @path is to be interpreted.\r\n\r\n3\\. If there is no @target, then the @path is interpreted relative to the \r\ndocument root\r\n\r\nThis supports the use cases Gabby mentions on ticket \\#1933198 without \r\nmuch difficulty, e.g.\r\n\r\nJohn Smith \\(bishop &lt;date xml:id=\u201dd002\u201d from=\u201d1753\u201d \r\nto=\u201d1795\u201d&gt;1753-c.1795&lt;/date&gt;\\)\r\n&lt;precision target=\u201d\\#d002\u201d path=\"@to\u201d locus=\"value\" degree=\u201d0.2\u201d/&gt;\r\n\r\nIt also offers all sorts of other delightful possibilities e.g.\r\n\r\n&lt;certainty path=\"//\\*/@resp='\\#lb'\u201d locus=\"value\" degree=\u201d0.2\u201d/&gt;\r\n\r\nAll in favour?\r\n",

  "description": "When editing \\(probably using copy/paste\\) an element's content model in Roma, it is very easy to accidentally remove the content-element surrounding the content model description. This naturally prevents the changed content model being used. As the changed content model is still being output in the saved customisation \\(albeit without the content-element that should surround it\\) the error may be hard to spot. \r\n\r\nThe request is therefore for Roma to check whether the content-element is present in the user-entered contents, and to raise an error if this is not the case. \r\n\r\nAlternative resolution: add a content-element if it has not been entered by the user. \r\n",

Now that it is 4 month ago, I have to \"recover\" my thoughts:\r\n\r\nFrom a philosophical point of view I thought about how possibly an element being a special type of quotation could be excluded from model.quoteLike?\r\n\r\nThen you are right , Lou, in guessing it even might have been because of the content model. I think I proposed it because of the lack of &lt;bibl&gt; and &lt;quote&gt; in the content model. For medieval text it is very much possible that incipits etc. may contain phrases from other texts, which editors/cataloguers might want to make more explicit. If the community feels \\(or the practice shows\\) that &lt;ref&gt;/&lt;ptr&gt; is enough to ensure this I might drop the proposal to enlarge the content model.\r\n\r\nBut, as my second paragraph might explain, I have been aware of the fact that &lt;incipit&gt; etc serve special needs and that they therefore still might needed to be destinguished be forming a certain subtype of model.\r\n\r\nTo sum up: The quoteLike elements should form a group. The content model of the elements to be added to the model might be expanded towards macro.specialPara.",

Though reasonable, this is a real problem for large conversion projects where some parts of the input text can definitely be assigned to one of the specialized elements, and other parts cannot. The only option at present is to treat the whole of the input as unstructured, which loses information unnecessarily.

But I can not think of any case in which it is a sensible restriction. It is almost \\*always\\* the case that for a particular bit of information someone may have useful things to say that fit neatly into the structured components the TEI has provided, \\*and\\* simultaneously have other, non-structured things they'd like to say.\r\n\r\nI strongly recommend that all such content models in the TEI \\(I will try to provide a list shortly\\) be reviewed, and unless there is compelling reason to prohibit the combination of both structured and unstructured data, the content model be changed to be more similar to the content model of the P2 to P4 &lt;encodingDesc&gt; element, which permitted structured information \\(albeit differently than P5\\) followed by a series of zero or more paragraphs. This was a brilliant way of addressing both the desire to describe in a machine-processable way certain bits of information, and also the desire to describe in prose that which requires further details or cannot be described in the structured elements.\r\n\r\nThus, for &lt;physDesc&gt;, I am suggesting\r\n\\( model.physDescPart\\_sequence\\_optional, modelpLike\\* \\)\r\nBut more important than whether the model.pLike goes before or after the rest, I am suggesting that all such elements should have this improvement.\r\n",

The main reason is \nthat Lou's initial request makes the assumption that, given the \nflexibility of ISO 8601 syntax, @when-iso is capable of being fully \nsynonymous with any of the other att.datable.iso attributes \\(largely \nbecause the syntax permits \\(a\\) the expression of a duration, and \\(b\\) the \nexpression of from-to intervals using a solidus \\(/\\) separator. But in \nfact there is no way in ISO 8601 syntax to express the semantics of \n\"notBefore\" and \"notAfter\", so @notBefore-iso and @notAfter-iso could \nnot be eliminated without loss of expressive ability, which defeats the \ngoal of conflating the \\*-iso atttributes into att.datable.\n\n2\\. The main thing you can do with full ISO 8601 date/time syntax that \nyou can't do with the W3C Schema datatype subset of ISO 8601, beside \nexpressing intervals using a \"/\" separator, is to represent dates and \ntimes with reduced accuracy. For example, to express \"from 2 to 3 p.m.\", \nW3C syntax requires\n&lt;time from=\"14:00:00\" to=\"15:00:00\"/&gt;\nwhereas with ISO 8601 you can say\n&lt;time from-iso=\"T14\" to=\"T15\"/&gt;\nwhich some people prefer as it makes no implicit claim to precision.\n\nSyd thinks that if the main \\(or only\\) thing we get out of adding ISO \n8601 syntax is a way of expessing imprecise times, we should investigate \nwhether we can eliminate the \\*-iso attribute series in favor of some \nother way, using new attributes, to express the same thing.\n\nIn the meantime, he and I are going to see whether we think we can come \nup with a regular expression pattern that more accurately constrains the \nallowable values for the \\*-iso series, as the current pattern facet is \ntoo permissive.\n\n\nI'd also add that, having gone to the trouble of adding the whole \natt.datable.iso class for P5, it would be a bit odd to withdraw it \nmid-stream, so I don't see this as anything that could happen before P6 \nin any case. \\(For reference, the first proposal for adding an ISO class \nwas in Syd's Council email from 2007-01:\n\nhttp://lists.village.virginia.edu/pipermail/tei-council/2007/006725.html\n\n\\)",

This is metadata descriptions not editions of transcriptions.  \n\nI would strongly oppose any removal of @target since the two functions \\(pointing to transcriptions and recording the locations are different things\\). @from and @to cannot be used in this manner because they are \\(properly in my mind\\) defined as data.word and so don't allow whitespace.\n\n-James\n",

The construct &lt;supplied&gt;xxxxx&lt;/supplied&gt; is what I use if I wish to insert an \u201cxxxxx\u201d for some other reason, typically because my source is illegible due to being damaged, a poor photocopy, or miserable handwriting, or some such.\n\nSo one could argue that &lt;supplied reason=\"apparent error\"&gt;xxxxx&lt;/supplied&gt; is syntactic sugar for &lt;choice&gt;&lt;sic/&gt;&lt;corr&gt;xxxxx&lt;/corr&gt;&lt;/choice&gt;, but that doesn't let us eliminate any of the involved elements, and I don't think it makes the encoding system simpler, myself.\n\n&gt; Syd: I am talking about the Manuscript SIG meeting in London \u2026\nThanks\\!

It is perhaps unhelpful to compare this to \"supplied\", since it is a different kind of editorial intervention. \\(Supplied text is restored by the editor to indicate damage, error, or some other cause of omission of original text--it is relatively agnostic as to why the text was lost/omitted.\\)\r\n\r\nIn my field, this criterion of editorial markup is clearly recognised: the Leiden Conventions use curly braces to represent this phenomenon \\(\"litterae errore adiectae quas editor expunxit\", e.g. dedika\\{ra\\}runt \\[citing Panciera 1980\\]\\). Currently EpiDoc--which aims to match Leiden concepts 1-to-1 with TEI patterns, recommends the use of \"sic\" for this distinction \\(see http://www.stoa.org/epidoc/gl/dev/erroneousinclusion.html which is somewhat out of date but current for this purpose\\).\r\n\r\nElena supplies a different kind of example:\r\n&lt;l n=\"4\"&gt;a darmi morte, poi m'avete preso &lt;omit&gt;a tradimento&lt;/omit&gt;&lt;/l&gt;\r\n&lt;l n='5'&gt;s\u00ec com' l'uccellator prende l'uccello&lt;/l&gt;\r\n&lt;gap/&gt;\r\n&lt;l n=\"43\"&gt;e lettere dintorno che diriano &lt;omit&gt;in questa guisa&lt;/omit&gt;&lt;/l&gt;\r\n&lt;l n=\"44\"&gt;Pi\u00f9 v'amo, d\u00eba, che non faccio Deo&lt;/l&gt;\r\n\r\nWhere the text marked here with \"omit\" is identified by the editor \\(Contini 1960\\) as interpolated and doesn't fit in the meter; it is marked in the printed text with a smaller font. This is a clear case where \"sic\" is not appropriate, since it is not athetized by the editor because of scribal error, but for another reason. Nevertheless, it seems preferable to mark these two things with the same element.\r\n\r\n\"Sic\" alone is not unambiguous, despite the EpiDoc recommendation cited above:\r\n\r\nEleph&lt;sic&gt;eph&lt;/sic&gt;ant\r\nor\r\nEleph&lt;choice&gt;&lt;sic&gt;eph&lt;/sic&gt;&lt;corr/&gt;&lt;/choice&gt;ant\r\n\r\ncould mean either that the second \"eph\" is \\(a\\) included in error, and marked as superfluous by the editor, or \\(b\\) is marked by the editor as an error, but with no statement as to what the correct form should be. This situation could be solved with an attribute \\(which wouldn't solve the case with interpolated verses\\), or a new element \\(which would\\).\r\n\r\nA final comment/recommendation re the element name: this is not a \"gap\" \\(which marks text missing from the edition, and therefore is empty element\\), but rather an editorial intervention marking text as superfluous. I don't much like the name \"omit\", despite its claimed parallelism with \"supplied\", since it seems to be a processing instruction rather than a description of what is in the text. \\(As noted above, \"supplied\" is a description of how this text gets into the edition when it is not in the source text. Our superfluous text may not be omitted--as in the verse example above in a smaller font, or the Leiden example in curly braces.\\) I would prefer something with the semantics of \"superfluous\", rather than \"omit\", \"suppress\", \"expunxit\"/\"expunged\" or the like.

  "description": "Summary: an ODD customization file needs to be able to say \"I am a customization of that customization\" as opposed to a customization of the whole TEI.\r\n\r\nCurrently a TEI customization is written as an ODD file that works by loading modules and obtaining information about TEI classes, etc., from a copy of the TEI source. The set of specifications from the specified modules in the TEI source are established, and requests to add, delete, replace, or change elements, classes, etc. are made against that set of specifications.\r\nE.g., by default the commandline roma.sh uses the sources obtainable through http://tei.oucs.ox.ac.uk/Query/ \\(to find out which actual version of the TEI sources that server is using, see http://tei.oucs.ox.ac.uk/Query/getversion.xq\\). This can be over-ridden to use any other TEI XQuery server with the --teiserver switch, or to use a local copy of the source files using the --localsource switch.\r\nThus we say that a customization is \"built against\" the TEI source. But in order for ODD to properly represent the delta from one encoding scheme to another, and thus gain the advantages of so doing, an ODD customization must be able to be built against another ODD customization, rather than against the TEI sources.\r\nA limited version of this can already be accomplished. One can specify as the local source using the --localsource switch the \"compiled ODD\" file that was created by a previous execution of roma.sh that had the --compile or --debug switch specified. But this is unsatisfactory for several reasons:\r\n1\\) It is not descriptive, has no abstraction\r\n2\\) An ODD itself does not formally indicate against which it should be built\r\n3\\) Customized attribute classes cannot be customized \\(as they are no longer first-class objects in the compiled ODD\\)\r\n4\\) The compiled ODD must reside on the local machine\r\n5\\) This is very hard for ordinary users to accomplish \\(although a front-end might alleviate that\\)\r\nSo I suggest TEI needs a mechanism for a &lt;schemaSpec&gt; to specify that against which it should be built. This should likely take the form of an attribute to &lt;schemaSpec&gt;, perhaps customizationOf=, which points \\(probably via URI, but perhaps by co-reference?\\) to an ODD customization file. If this optional attribute were not specified, the default would be to build against the usual TEI source, of course.",

        "text": "My fears with this is it might encourage fragmentation and dispersal of version specification.  By that I mean we get an increasing number of specification whose relation back to the TEI is much harder to trace.  MyODD version 1.0 is a customisation of WibbleODD version 1.2 which is a customisation of TEI4Dummies version 0.85.  Each of these customsations moves on separately with different version numbering systems, and are no longer available, it becomes increasingly difficult to know what version of the TEI they were originally built against.  Equally it has to be easily possible to say that it wasn't built against any version of the TEI.  \n\nI'm not against this as an idea... as you know I like the idea of being able to do weird things with ODD \\(e.g. embedding in encodingDesc of document instances, schematron, embedding crosswalk information to other formats in ODD, etc.\\)... I'd just want to make sure that maybe we record for each iteration of customisation the information in the ODD somehow.  So I can know that TEI version P5 1.5.8 was used to create TEI4Dummies 0.85 which was used to create wibbleODD version 1.2 from which I made myODD 1.0.  So a requirement of customisation then becomes the embedding of any previous customisation version numbering?  Does that make any sense? \n\nEqually is it easy for myODD v.1.0 to revert something back to the way one of the other ODDs, or the TEI, does it... but not quite sure how that would be accomplished.\n\nSimiarly, for any \\*Spec should it also be possible also to include the definition of that \\*Spec from a remote location? And override only certain parts \\(like the &lt;desc&gt;\\)?  I noticed that a lot of times we have duplicate attributes in the TEI that aren't all in an attribute class it is to give very minor differences of &lt;desc&gt;.\n\n-James",

Currently we're able to reference an element's definition by pointing to its element reference page.  This is a convenient shorthand both in pedagogy and discussions about the TEI generally.  What the current website doesn't do is preserve all the major 6th-monthly releases of the TEI so that we can point to the TEI as a changing and evolving thing.  That is, we can't easily have a meaningfully referenced discussion on the theoretical or practical evolution of the TEI at a meta level because we don't have an easy mechanism to point to the element definitions for one release compared to another.  \\(The reason I say it isn't 'easy' rather than saying we can't do it, is because we \\_can\\_ point to sourceforge and individual subversion commits, but there is no easy way of doing so for a set of elements belonging to release 1.0.3 vs 1.1.3 or something since these are done on a commit-by-commit basis.\\)  \r\n\r\nMy suggestion would be to archive ad infinitum previous 6th-monthly releases on the TEI website with a footer link pointing to the most recent version.  If a DOI system were to be adopted, then this version number should obviously be an optional part of it.  \\(with a :current: or similar for the current release at any time\\).\r\n\r\nBut in general I think this idea has merit and should be explored with the TEI in Libraries community.\r\n\r\n-James",

        "text": "SF 2493417 consists of two parts. The first part asks for some extra examples that show idno's are not necessarily numeric. Syd provided some examples in SF bug 2457147. \n\nThe second part of the feature request requests of &lt;idno&gt; that we 'extend its scope so that it can treat unique identifiers for core components of a bibliographical reference, in particular, authors \\(it should thus be part of the content model of &lt;author&gt; among others'. The rest of this comment discusses that second request. \n\nIt is clear there are many advantages to unique identification of scholarly authors: finding an author\u2019s other articles, finding an author\u2019s current affiliation, relating non-article publications \\(weblog entries, etc.\\) all require some more robust way of identifying a person than by name.  An illustration of that fact is given by \\[1\\]: the Mathematical Reviews author database contains 32 authors called \"Wang, Wei\" with no additional names.  For more literature, see \\[2, 3, 4\\].\n\nIt should therefore be possible to identify scholarly authors by something other than their name. There exist, perhaps unfortunately, several initiatives to assign unique id's to scholarly authors, such as Researcher ID \\(http://www.researcherid.com/\\) and Digital Author Identifier \\(http://www.surffoundation.nl/smartsite.dws?ch=ENG&id=13480\\). Others have argued researchers should be identified through their OpenID accounts \\(http://openid.net/\\). National libraries have their \\(overlapping\\) authority files. There exists an upcoming ISO standard for identifying names/entities: International Standard Name Identifier \\(http://www.isni.org/\\). Elsevier has its Scopus id\u2019s.  \n\nIt should be possible to store these author identifiers in \\(TEI\\) bibliographies. We could achieve that effect in a number of ways:\n\\(1\\) use @key on an &lt;author&gt;\u2019s &lt;name&gt;\n\\(2\\) use @ref on an &lt;author&gt;\u2019s &lt;name&gt;\n\\(3\\) add &lt;author&gt; to att.canonical and use @key or @ref on &lt;author&gt;\n\\(4\\) create a new element &lt;authorid&gt; and add it to &lt;author&gt;\u2019s content model\n\\(5\\) extend the scope of the existing element &lt;idno&gt; and add &lt;idno&gt; to &lt;author&gt;\u2019s content model\n\nAny solution will however have to cater for the fact that authors may have multiple digital author identifiers, corresponding to different scheme\u2019s. E.g.:\n\\- an International Standard Name Identifier might one day look like urn:isni:12341234\n\\- a researcher id looks like C-1234-2008 or http://www.researcherid.com/rid/ C-1234-2008\n\\- a Dutch DAI looks like: info:eu-repo/dai/nl/12456454 \n\\- an open id might look like: https://me.yahoo.com/johndoe61\n\nThis means that any solutions that rely on attributes will either need to somehow store the identification scheme in the attribute, or have to rely on parsing the value to guess what scheme is applicable. @key has the added problem that it holds by definition only one value, so even if \nkey=\"researcherid:C-1234-2008\"\nwould work, it could not at the same time hold the International Standard Name Identifier for the researcher. @ref could hold multiple values, but must contain uri\u2019s; we could have\nref=\"info:eu-repo/dai/nl/12456454 https://me.yahoo.com/johndoe61\" \nbut then software would have to guess what scheme is applicable. \n\nThis implies that for a robust solution we need a repeatable element that stores the identifier\u2019s scheme as a type or scheme attribute, and the value either as text or as a value attribute. We can either create a new element for the purpose, e.g. &lt;authorid&gt;, or reuse an existing element. \n\nThe proposal here is to use the existing &lt;idno&gt; element. The need to identify authors is exactly analogous to the need to identify bibliographic elements such as articles or monographs, the element has already an appropriately generic name, and I see no reason why not to use it. This does not involve, as Syd wrote on the TEI in Libraries mailing list \\(https://listserv.indiana.edu/cgi-bin/wa-iub.exe?A2=ind0901B&L=TEILIB-L&T=0&F=&S=&P=2774\\), a \u2018semantic shift\u2019: &lt;idno&gt; would have the same meaning it always had, it would just be applied to new elements.\n\nThis would involve:\n\\- changing the definition of idno from \u2018supplies any standard or non-standard number used to identify a bibliographic item\u2019 to e.g. \u2018supplies any standard or non-standard number used to identify bibliographic elements\u2019\n\\- adding &lt;idno&gt; to &lt;author&gt;\u2019s content model, presumably as its first element. \n\nWe could then have e.g.\n&lt;author&gt;\n&lt;idno type=\"nldai\"&gt;info:eu-repo/dai/nl/12456454&lt;/idno&gt;\n&lt;idno type=\"openid\"&gt; https://me.yahoo.com/johndoe61&lt;/idno&gt;\nJohn Doe\n&lt;/author&gt;\n\n\\[1\\] TePaske-King, B. and Richert, N. \\(2001\\), 'The identification of authors in the Mathematical Reviews Database', Issues in Science and Technology Librarianship, 31.\n\\[2\\] Bourne, Philip E. and Fink, J.

First, it is worth pointing out that in the example Peter provides text content is put at the same \"level\" as element content, which most of us find distirbing. So I would suggest instead \n&lt;author&gt;\n&lt;idno type=\"nldai\"&gt;info:eu-repo/dai/nl/12456454&lt;/idno&gt;\n&lt;idno type=\"openid\"&gt; https://me.yahoo.com/johndoe61&lt;/idno&gt;\n&lt;persName&gt;John Doe&lt;/persName&gt;\n&lt;/author&gt;\n\nBut more importantly, before you permit &lt;idno&gt; in the innards of &lt;author&gt;, &lt;editor&gt;, &lt;publisher&gt;, etc., I'd like to know know what are the explicit semantics? Problematic to just say \"an identifier for the thingy indicated by the parent element\", because the parent is canonically &lt;publicationStmt&gt;.\n\nAlso I'm also a little worried about what multiple occurrences mean. Are the two &lt;idno&gt;s in the above example alternative identifiers of the same author \\(in this case a person\\)? Or are there three authors? If the answer to you is immediately obvious \"alternative\", think about the analagous cases:\n\n&lt;author&gt;\n&lt;persName type=\"common\"&gt;Peter Boot&lt;/persName&gt;\n&lt;persName type=\"regularized\"&gt;Boot, Dr. Peter&lt;/persName&gt;\n&lt;persName xml:lang=\"es\"&gt;Pedro Cargador&lt;/persName&gt;\n&lt;/author&gt;\nvs.\n&lt;author&gt;\n&lt;persName&gt;Syd Bauman&lt;/persName&gt;\n&lt;persName&gt;Peter Boot&lt;/persName&gt;\n&lt;persName&gt;Kevin Hawkins&lt;/perssName&gt;\n&lt;/author&gt;\n\nThe Guidelines license the multiple authors in one &lt;author&gt; approach.\n",

However, I'm not sure the TEI Guidelines could really get away with such a requirement now, for two reasons.\r\n\r\nFirst, using one &lt;author&gt; to encode multiple authors is explicitly permitted in P5. Second, it would break the parallelism between &lt;author&gt; and &lt;respStmt&gt;&lt;resp&gt;author&lt;/resp&gt;&lt;/respStmt&gt;.

So the documentation on identifiers can be added.\r\n\r\nI've added examples of authors at revision 10377:\r\n\r\nhttp://tei.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/tei/trunk/P5/Source/Guidelines/en/CO-CoreElements.xml?r1=10377&r2=10376&pathrev=10377\r\n\r\nFurther suggestions welcome.",

  "description": "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI'd like to suggest adding a @scope attribute to &lt;rendition/&gt; which allows specification of CSS pseudo-elements, in order to more fully utilize the expressive ability of CSS in TEI. These pseudo-elements are used to target styling for only a portion of the given text. For example, there is a 'first-letter' pseudo-element to target styling of the first letter in the targeted element, while there are the useful \"before\" and \"after\" pseudo-elements, used often in conjunction with the \"content\" property to add some styling characters \\(Unicode provides quite a few\\) before or after the element.\r\n\r\nFor example, the CSS \"first-letter\" pseudo-element might be encoded under this proposal as follows:\r\n\r\n&lt;rendition xml:id=\"dropcaps\" scope=\"first-letter\" scheme=\"css\"&gt;font-size:xx-large&lt;/rendition&gt;\r\n...\r\n&lt;p rendition=\"\\#dropcaps\"&gt;Once upon a time...&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\nThe \"O\" in \"Once\" would thus be indicated as having drop-caps in the original \\(and stylesheets could use this information in a predictable and standard way to create such drop-caps\\). This would not rely on \"hacks\" such as using XSLT to extract pseudo-element information added within &lt;rendition&gt;\r\n\r\nThe above would also solve the current need for relying on the non-CSS PRE or POST convention \\(as used in your default stylesheets\\) for specifying use of different quotation marks without actually encoding them in the text \\(:before and :after pseudo-elements could be used under @scope in conjunction with the 'content' property\\).\r\n\r\n&lt;rendition xml:id=\"quoteBefore\" scheme=\"css\" scope=\"before\"&gt;content: '\"';&lt;/rendition&gt;\r\n&lt;rendition xml:id=\"quoteAfter\" scheme=\"css\" scope=\"after\"&gt;content: '\"';&lt;/rendition&gt;\r\n...\r\n&lt;p rendition=\"\\#quoteBefore \\#quoteAfter\"&gt;Four score and seven years ago...&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n\\(The above adds quotation marks--which could instead be curly ones, etc.--at the beginning and end of the paragraph.\\)\r\n\r\nI think this would further build on TEI's advantages in offering to fully allow rendering information of the original to be encoded but while allowing for sufficient separation so that reproducers can choose whether to replicate these features in their own version or not \\(e.g., in the proposed system, a reproducer could more easily change the style of quotation marks\\).",

As the CSS 2.1 specifications note,\r\n\"Pseudo-elements create abstractions about the document tree beyond those\r\nspecified by the document language. For instance, document languages do not\r\noffer mechanisms to access the first letter or first line of an element's\r\ncontent. CSS pseudo-elements allow style sheet designers to refer to this\r\notherwise inaccessible information.\"\r\n\\(http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/selector.html\\#pseudo-elements\\)\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION:\r\n\r\nThe feature request should be implemented.\r\n\r\nIMPLEMENTATION NOTES:\r\n\r\nThe elementSpec for &lt;rendition&gt; will additionally take &lt;addDef ident=\"scope\"&gt; as\r\nclosed value list, with permitted values being \"first-line\", \"first-letter\",\r\n\"before\", and \"after\". \\(These are all the CSS pseudo-elements defined in\r\ncurrent CSS as well as in the CSS 3 draft.\\)\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION:\r\n\r\nThere is one potential problem with enabling this @scope attribute, which is\r\nthat apart from :first-letter, the pseudo-elements are perhaps more useful\r\nfor describing the rendition of original XML documents rather than encoded\r\ntexts. For example, the CSS rule\r\n\r\np:first-line \\{ text-transform: uppercase \\}\r\n\r\ndescribes the intended appearance of \\*output text\\*, not of original text.\r\nIn a Web browser, as one resizes the window, the length of the first line\r\nwill change. Similarly, if one is transcribing the actual characters of a\r\ntext, one will generally not use :before and :after to generate output text.\r\n\\(But the TEI elements for quotation are a clear case where @scope would be\r\nuseful, as Brett notes\\). If we are clear in the Guidelines about the\r\nintended use of @scope, I don't think this is a fatal problem.\r\n",

As for what is to be done, he has four suggestions, and my comments follow\n\na. Nothing\n\nTempting for simplicity but not the best option\n\nb. Define a class for the most common case \\(required, singleton\nvalue\\)\n\nI like the idea of having a class, and this seems to be the simplest and most popular option.\n\nc. Either allow @cRef consistently or deprecate, and then abolish, it\n\nI don't like either of these ideas. @cRef on e.g. &lt;note&gt; or &lt;locus&gt; simply doesn't make sense \\(I suppose one might create a note pointing to a canonical reference but I can't really see it\\), but as someone who has used @cRef on &lt;ref&gt; for pointing to biblical references it's a nice one to have. \n\nd. Ditto for @targetEnd\n\nThis issue was taken care of under FR 2494567, in which @targetEnd has been depreciated for new encoding in favour of target=\"range\\(\\)\" \\(although @targetEnd has not been and will not be, I think, removed\\)",

Added schematron rules to link, join and alt. Remove references to @targets in prose of SA; tidy up prose a tiny bit.\r\n\r\n3\\. No change made in use of @cRef yet.

I've\ntried to outline the salient points as I see them, but as I don't use\nthese I don't feel comfortable making a yes or no recommendation to\nthis specific request. I do think that something needs to be done,\nboth on the question of what one should do when one's description\ndoesn't follow the prescribed order of height, width, depth, but\nparticularly the second question, of using &lt;measure&gt; for things like\ndiameter and circumference \\(which I think is not as simple as placing\na @type on &lt;measure&gt;\\).\n\nThe issue of changing the definitions of &lt;dimensions&gt; and child\nelements in the Guidelines to be less manuscript-centric \\(which Gabby\nbrought up in a SF comment\\) should definitely be done.\n\nDot\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n&lt;dimensions&gt; is described as a specialized form of measure \\(\"The\ndimensions element can be used to specify the size of some aspect of\nthe manuscript, and thus may be thought of as a specialized form of\nthe existing TEI measure element.\"\\)\n\n&lt;dimensions&gt; is paragraph-level; it should thus be capable of encoding\nnarrative descriptions. In the case of inscribed stones, it is not a\ngiven that descriptions always follow the format\n&lt;height&gt;&lt;width&gt;&lt;depth&gt;. Thus it seems that ordering of these elements\nwithin &lt;dimensions&gt; should be loosened up.\n\nHowever, the same effect could potentially be had using\n&lt;height&gt;&lt;width&gt;&lt;depth&gt;&lt;measure&gt; \\(of various types\\) without\n&lt;dimensions&gt;, as all of these are paragraph-level in their own right,\nbut if you do this then you need a way to link them together as\nelements of dimensions.\n\nA second issue in this feature request is defining &lt;measure&gt;\nspecifically for things like circumference and diameter \\(as @types\\),\nrather than as new elements, however  &lt;measure&gt; is not a member of\natt.dimensions. It is a member of att.measurement so has @unit,\n@quantity, @commodity, additionally @type and global, but\natt.dimensions has additionally @extent, @atLeast, @atMost, @min,\n@max, @precision, @scope \\(but not @commodity or @type\\). If &lt;measure&gt;\nis to be used for these other \"dimensions-like\" things, council should\nconsider whether it should be added to att.dimensions \\(that is, would\ndiameter or circumference need these attributes as much as height,\nwidth, and depth?\\)",

Is it a closed or an open list? In my view, it should be a closed list. Also, I think the purpose of this is \\*not\\* to allow identical @values to be given using different representations, but to allow for @values which can \\*only\\* be expressed in some different format \\(e.g. irrational numbers or fractions\\). So I would not allow hex, octal or binary, since these are all different ways of representing the same intended values. \\(If you doubt this, consider the case of a hex string which represents a floating point number in the usual mantissa+exponent form: what use is it to be told this is in hex if you don't know it's actually representing a float? the same hex string could equally well be representing an integer value in 2s complement format\\! So it's not helpful to be told it's in hex -- much more use to be told it's a float\\!\r\n\r\nI suggest the values should be just the following:\r\ndecimal \\(default\\)\r\nfloat  \\(the @value contains a mantissa and an exponent e.g. 2.356e1000\\)\r\nratio \\(the @value contains two integers and a slash e.g. 22/7\\)\r\n\r\nI cannot for the life of me see the point of using @type on &lt;num&gt; to show how its \\*content\\* is represented. The usage for this attribute proposed in the Guidelines is more to do with the \\*value\\*  with suggested values ordinal, fraction, percentage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

  "description": "Bertrand Gaiffe and others have mentioned the need to record information of audio/video files which are provided in facsimile of the transcribed text.  Particularly to be able to reference zones or ranges in these surrogates.  They appropriated facsimile and zone for this usage.  The point isn't to describe them \\(as one would in sourceDesc\\) but to have ranges and three and four dimensional zones which can then be referenced as facsimile content elsewhere inside a transcription, exactly the way one currently uses @facs to point to a zone in an image.  If one's facsimile is not an image, but a video/audio/other then it is much more complicated to do this in TEI currently.   While they may have been able to use timeline for this, perhaps the TEI should re-examine the way it handles audio/video/graphic files to make sure that we have some joined-up thinking on the way we handle pointing into portions and zones of multimedia objects.\r\n\r\n-James",

Particularly to be able to reference zones or ranges in these surrogates.  They appropriated facsimile and zone for this usage.  The point isn't to describe them \\(as one would in sourceDesc\\) but to have ranges and three and four dimensional zones which can then be referenced as facsimile content elsewhere inside a transcription, exactly the way one currently uses @facs to point to a zone in an image.  If one's facsimile is not an image, but a video/audio/other then it is much more complicated to do this in TEI currently.   While they may have been able to use timeline for this, perhaps the TEI should re-examine the way it handles audio/video/graphic files to make sure that we have some joined-up thinking on the way we handle pointing into portions and zones of multimedia objects.\n \n -James\n\n~~~~\n\n- **status**: open --> closed-duplicate\n",

        "text": "I have not forgotten that I was supposed to be coming up with\r\na sample list of relationships between related bibliographical items to\r\nserve as exemplary values for @type \\(and/or @subtype\\)\r\non the element &lt;relatedItem&gt;.\r\n\r\nI took an inductive approach, surveying the kinds of\r\nrelationships expressed in the bibliographies attached\r\nto about 400 Michigan faculty curricula vitae \\(vitarum?\\),\r\nand then added those found in my own ancient dissertation\r\nbibliography, as well as the canonical relationships\r\nenshrined in the MARC linking fields.\r\n\r\nThere is no end of possible permutations. MARC lists only\r\na few, and dispenses with the rest by means of the catch-all\r\n787 field \\(unspecified relationship: supply details in a 580\r\n'complexity note'\\). TEI encoders would probably do well to\r\nfollow a similar practice: there is no ready way to get\r\n\"Middle Scots paraphrase \\(with the aid of a Middle English\r\ncrib\\) of an Old French version of a Catalan original\" into\r\na @type. Such things demand to be treated more discursively.\r\n\r\nMost of the likely relationships appear\r\nnaturally as pairs, depending on which end of the relationship\r\nis taken as the primary entry, and which is nested within it\r\nas related. E.g.\r\n\r\n@type=\"translatedAs\"\r\n@type=\"translatedFrom\"\r\n@type=\"adaptedAs\"\r\n@type=\"adaptedFrom\"\r\n@type=\"modernizedFrom\"\r\n@type=\"modernizedAs\"\r\n\r\n\r\nbut a few are bidirectional or neutral as to direction:\r\n\r\n@type=\"alsoIssuedas\"\r\n@type=\"alsoPublishedIn\"\r\n\r\nHow to express the relationship is a another question. MARC in its\r\ndescriptions mostly uses the participial form, as above. And it definitely\r\nhas advantages, since the nominal forms of the unidirectional pairs\r\ntend to end up as ugly hyphenated compounds or risk losing the connection \r\nbetween the paired forms. E.g. one could use type=\"translation\" \r\ntype=\"paraphrase\" type=\"adaptation\" \\(or type=\"translation\" subtype=\"exact\" \r\n/ \"paraphrase\" / \"adaptation\" etc.\\) but then be faced with poor choices\r\nas to how to handle the reverse relationship: \"type=\"translation-original\"\r\ntype=\"adaptation-original\" etc. \\(\"original\" means too many things, I \r\nthink.\\)\r\n\r\nThe bidirectional relationships, on the other hand are perhaps better \r\nexpressed as nouns or noun phrases:\r\n\r\n@type=\"otherForm\"\r\n@type=\"otherEdition\"\r\n@type=\"otherLanguage\"\r\n\r\nProbably, as usual, I am thinking about this the wrong way.\r\nBut till I'm told otherwise, I tend towards using phrasal\r\n@types to describe relationships--verbal phrases for those\r\nthat indicate direction, and nominal phrases for those that\r\nare neutral or static.\r\n\r\nFinally, how to make best use of @type and @subtype in\r\ncombination depends a lot on how one is accustomed to doing\r\nso. This my first attempt assumes that @type should be used\r\nfor the primary description of the relationship, @subtype\r\nfor qualifiers. E.g.\r\n\r\n@subtype=\"inPart\"\r\n@subtype=\"dataOnly\"\r\n@subtype=\"extractsOnly\"\r\n@subtype=\"withAdditions\"\r\n@subtype=\"withRevisions\"\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder those assumptions, all of which are probably\r\ncontroversial, alongside those given above, a healthy sample might \r\ninclude:\r\n\r\n\r\n@type=\"supplementedBy\"\r\n@type=\"supplementTo\"\r\n\r\n@type=\"issuedWith\"\r\n@type=\"accompanies\"\r\n\r\n@type=\"continues\"\r\n@type=\"supersedes\"\r\n@type=\"combines\"\r\n@type=\"absorbs\"\r\n@type=\"separatedFrom\"\r\n\r\n@type=\"continuedBy\"\r\n@type=\"supersededBy\"\r\n\r\n@type=\"absorbedBy\"\r\n@type=\"splitInto\"\r\n@type=\"mergedWith\"\r\n@type=\"revertsTo\"\r\n@type=\"partOf\"\r\n@type=\"includes\"\r\n@type=\"includedIn\"\r\n\r\n@type=\"sequelTo\"\r\n@type=\"followedBy\"\r\n\r\n@type=\"revisionOf\"\r\n@type=\"revisedAs\"\r\n\r\n@type=\"abridgementOf\"\r\n@type=\"abridgedFrom\"\r\n\r\n@type=\"expansionOf\"\r\n@type=\"expandedFrom\"\r\n\r\n@type=\"reprintedAs\"\r\n@type=\"reprintedFrom\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI'll go no further in case I'm on the wrong track altogether.\r\n\r\npfs\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\\----------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nSome raw data...\r\n\r\n\r\n1\\.

  "description": "\r\nThe HTML version of the TEI Guidelines should give greater and more flexible access to all other uses of an element in another example in the prose of the Guidelines \\(in all language versions\\) and the element specifications. 'examples' in this case means an &lt;exemplum&gt; in the element specifications or &lt;egXML&gt; in any language of the guidelines which contains somewhere inside it that element.\r\n\r\nOne possible solution for this is to create an eg-elementName.html parallel to all ref-elementName.html which lists all examples fitting that description.  These should be sorted first by language \\(alphabetically but with the user's current language first\\), and then by the ones which appear as &lt;exemplum&gt; before those which appear in the Guidelines.  Alternatively, it could list only the examples in the user's current language \\(wherever they are\\) but also provide links to the same eg-elementName.html page in the other language versions of the Guidelines.\r\n\r\nIn addition, from any individual example, you should be able to return to the context from which that example originates.  That is, hypothetically, if investigating &lt;persName&gt; you end up looking at an example of &lt;person&gt;, containing &lt;persName&gt;,  which was found in an &lt;exemplum&gt; for the spec of \\(say\\) &lt;listPerson&gt;, then there should be a way to return to reference page of &lt;listPerson&gt;.  If the example originates from the prose of the Guidelines a link should return you to at least the section of the Guidelines where that example is used, if not the very location of the example. \\(Hence the other feature request asking for @xml:id on every example.\\)\r\n\r\nWhile this will doubtless produce pages \\(for example with reference to &lt;p&gt;\\) which are quite large and of limited use, in other cases there would be significant benefit from this.\r\n\r\n-James",

Or, we could just have it say 'Wiki page on this element'  Additionally we could create a mediawiki template for such pages which contained other content...perhaps including a pointer back to the appropriate place in the TEI guidelines.\r\n\r\nSection headings in the Guidelines have URLs like \r\nhttp://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/HD.html\\#HD4C\r\n\r\nso would require some form of URL on the wiki like:\r\n\r\nhttp://wiki.tei-c.org/index.php/Guidelines:en/HD/HD4C\r\n\r\nWhere people could talk about this section on the &lt;creation&gt; element.\r\n\r\nWhether we want to do this for things which are not reference pages is still under discussion, as is whether this is a good idea at all.  I simply record it here so we don't forget to examine it.\r\n\r\n-James\r\n",

The ciore contains elements which appear in the majority of documents likely to be encountered, I am not convinced that this phenomenon is in that category. &lt;gap&gt;s, by contrast, can and do appear in all kinds of texts, and &lt;gap&gt; is pretty close to what you want.\r\n",

For this reason either a\\) a single attribute should be declared to point both to a vocabulary list in the TEI Header and to external URLs \\(i.e., data.pointer\\), \\*or\\* b\\) two separate attributes should be declared, one to point to an internal list and another to an external one. \n\n1\\) Within the TEI Header, there are two places that the targets of the pointer might be defined. The first is &lt;taxonomy&gt; and child &lt;category&gt;, which appears to be defined as to be used specifically for user-created taxonomies. The second is &lt;textClass&gt; and children, which appears to be defined as to be used for standard classification schemes and taxonomies and not user-created taxonomies, and which additionally is specifically for \"nature or topic of a text\" - and it is not immediately clear that the material from which an object is made would fit textClass as defined. \n\nIt would be preferable, I think, if in this case \\(and others\\) the Guidelines would define either one place for defining all vocabularies referenced in a document \\(either user-created or drawn from a standard\\), \\*or\\* clarify where precisely one is to define user-created taxonomies and where standard ones. I think that &lt;taxonomy&gt; would be a good place to define both, and &lt;textClass&gt; either done away with or strictly defined as being used to describe the \"nature or topic of a text\".\n\n2\\) What pointer attribute to use. @class \\(suggested by Lou\\) is described as pointing into &lt;textClass&gt;, not &lt;taxonomy&gt;/&lt;category&gt;. It could be extended to point into &lt;taxonomy&gt;. @class, however, is defined as data.code and may not point to an external URL. @ana is defined as \"indicates one or more elements containing interpretations of the element on which the ana attribute appears.\" I think this is pretty clearly not what we want here. @ref has the advantage of being defined as data.pointer, which gives it the ability to point both within the document and outside of it. Adding &lt;material&gt; to att.canonical \\(in addition to giving us @ref\\) would also give us @key, which would allow us to point to a database of terms.\n\nGoing from this, my recommendation would be 1\\) to add &lt;material&gt; to att.canonical, and 2\\) within the Guidelines, specify that if material points to vocabulary within the TEI Header, that vocabulary should be defined using &lt;taxonomy&gt; whether it is user-defined or drawn from a standard vocabulary/taxonomy.

This element does seem to be needed, as evidenced by the fact that EpiDoc have been using tei:rs\\[@type='object'\\] alongside tei:material for years now and Elli's USEP project is using tei:seg\\[@type='object'\\] alongside tei:seg\\[@type='material'\\] for at least as long.\r\n\r\nLou prefers the element name tei:objectType to the shorter tei:object because we're talking about values like \"sword\" \\(types\\) rather than like \"Excalibur\" \\(specific objects\\). We are less uncomfortable with the semantics of \"object\" being stretched to refer to a class of object, but there have been two further arguments in favour of the more explicit naming:\r\n\r\n\\(1\\) Tosten Schassan \\(below\\) demonstrates the possible misunderstanding associated with the name \"object\" in the context of \"support\" and \"supportDesc\".\r\n\r\n\\(2\\) Oyvind Eide \\(who proposed several new elements for encoding ontological information in LLC 24.2, p. 171, including \"physicalObject\"\\), verbally suggested to me that the important thing about this proposal is to make sure any new element is not named in such a way that it might be interpreted to mean something that would be used outside of its strict context in the MS Description module. \\(It may also be worth explicitly asking Oyvind and Christian-Emil Ore to comment on this proposal before Council decides to act upon it.\\)\r\n\r\nWe therefore propose that Council create a new element tei:objectType, which have the same content model and attribute classes as tei:material.\r\n\r\nI'm happy to help compose the description of this element for the elements list and general guidelines prose.\r\n",

I think one can transcribe an abbreviation and be uncertain about whether the transcription is accurate.  Likewise, the original might be the expansion.:\r\n\r\n&lt;choice&gt;\r\n&lt;expan&gt;North Atlantic Treaty Organization&lt;/expan&gt;\r\n&lt;abbr cert=\"low\"&gt;NorATO&lt;/abbr&gt;\r\n&lt;abbr cert=\"high\"&gt;NATO&lt;/abbr&gt;\r\n&lt;/choice&gt;\r\n\r\nIf it isn't intended that we can provide a choice between multiples of all of the model.choicePart members, then why-oh-why are they repeatable?   \\(In fact a good customisation example might be to make them not repeatable, and to have schematron rules enforce 'if you have &lt;sic&gt; you must have &lt;corr&gt;' or something similar to show how to do this \\(\\*note to self\\*\\)\\) \r\n\r\nIn saying all members of this class should also be members of the attribute class, I wasn't really meaning it as said.  I meant each individual element which the TEI happens to already have in choicePart should be a member of editLike. \\(And I'd want to include choice as well\\).  However, being able to have class dependencies based not just on particular elements or attributes, but on macros and class membership does seem like an attractive thing to have in ODD2. Maybe make a note of it at http://wiki.tei-c.org/index.php/ODD-dev ?\r\n\r\nI can envision use cases where I would want multiple &lt;orig&gt; elements to express potential alternative transcriptions, \\(and same with seg, abbr, sic, and choice\\). Or indeed, where I might want a &lt;choice&gt; between multiple &lt;abbr&gt; elements one of which I'm more confident about my reading, and not provide an expansion.\r\n\r\nIf &lt;choice&gt; isn't meant to be used this way then it should be more explicitly noted in discussion and reference pages.  \r\n\r\n-James",

The first example in the original request seems inadvisable to me: \n\n&lt;choice&gt;\n&lt;abbr cert=\"high\"&gt;I really think it says that&lt;/abbr&gt;\n&lt;abbr cert=\"low\"&gt;There is a vague possibility it says this other\nthing&lt;/abbr&gt;\n&lt;expan cert=\"high\"&gt;The probable expansion&lt;/expan&gt;\n&lt;expan cert=\"low\"&gt;The unlikely expansion&lt;/expan&gt;\n&lt;/choice&gt;\n\nThis leaves implicit which of the abbr's and expan's should be paired together.\nThe second example \n\n&lt;choice&gt;\n&lt;choice cert=\"high\"&gt;\n&lt;abbr&gt;I really think it says that&lt;/abbr&gt;\n&lt;expan&gt;The probable expansion&lt;/expan&gt;\n&lt;/choice&gt;\n&lt;choice cert=\"low\"&gt;\n&lt;abbr&gt;There is a vague possibility it says this other thing&lt;/abbr&gt;\n&lt;expan&gt;The unlikely expansion&lt;/expan&gt;\n&lt;/choice&gt;\n&lt;/choice&gt;\n\nis in this respect unambiguous. This argues for @cert on choice. \n\n3\\. From these examples, I see a reason to make @cert available on seg and on choice. \n\n4\\. However, James asks for '@cert or better att.editLike attributes'. But why, if we need only @cert, should we make the other, clearly irrelevant, attributes in att.editLike \\(att.dimensions and att.ranging\\) available? Why not stick with att.responsibility? \n\n5\\. In sum: my proposal would be to add choice and seg to att.responsibility",

  "description": "\r\nIt would be a handy feature for ROMA or ROMA-NG for it to look at the date the ODD was last saved, and output a list of new/changed elements/classes/modules that had been changed since the last time the ODD was saved.\r\n\r\nuse-case: A project or community has an ODD where they have tightly constrained the TEI.  As good TEI users they want to keep it in step with developments in the TEI, and so regenerate their schemas when a new version is out.  Suddenly they have a bunch of elements / attributes they don't want and have to go track them down.\r\n\r\nimplementation: This could be implemented as a webservice: You give it a date and you get back a list in some format with references to those bits which have changed.\r\n\r\nbackend-implications: This would mean that any time a substantive change \\(addition or modification of content model say\\) was made to an elementSpec or similar, the person editing it would have to update a date-related attribute which would have to be added to \\*Spec.  Implementing the webservice is a search through these attributes for any which are after the date provided. Existing \\*specs could be primed with a last revision date from subversion, somehow, I'm betting.\r\n\r\nSide benefits: It would also give a list of 'things changed since last maintenance release'.  Granted, not one with descriptions of the nature of the change, but it would be a help.  Reference pages could also include a 'This element was last edited at: @when' type phrase.\r\n\r\n-James",

This DOES NOT really answer the underlying problem of this ticket, but does make it go away in most instances.  By that I mean that if I'm pointing to version 1.3.0  and think \"maybe I should update my ODD and point at version 1.8.0\" I still have no way, as a general user, to know what the changes are between 1.3.0 with those elements included by my ODD and 1.8.0. Pointing to a specific version means that I'm no longer surprised by the sudden inclusion of new elements.  However, what I think the changes in 1.7.0 have done is enable the possibility of building something which does express differences between your ODD and current TEI similarly customised.  What we need is some enterprising person to write a web service like thing which says \"Ah, your ODD points to version 1.3.0 and you include only these elements/modules, if you changed this to $current you would get these changes: \\[list of changes\\]\".  If someone creates such a service, I think the TEI-C should host it.\r\n\r\nI think the TEI has now enabled the possibility of doing this.  Where it wasn't possible before \\(because I didn't know what version of the TEI you used, or have access to other versions of it easily\\) it is now possible.\r\n\r\nI accept that it is arguably not the TEI's job to create something to do this service.  However I would suggest that now that it possible we should encourage as good practice to point to the specific version of the TEI in the vault that an ODD is using.\r\n\r\nI'm happy for this ticket to be not-fixed because it may not be the TEI's job to create this but instead create the possibility of doing so, which it now has.\r\n\r\n-James",

  "description": "Adding all model.milestoneLike elements to the att.spanning class would address\r\nsome outstanding issues about the handling of multiple hierarchies in\r\na simple way. It would deliver on the rather vaguely worded promise\r\nthat TEI supports both a page-line and a div-para hierarchy, by\r\nsimplifying automatic conversion between them, and also addressing a\r\nlong standing technical issue about handling page boundaries.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n&lt;p xml:id=\"para1\"&gt; ... &lt;pb n=\"1\" xml:id=\"pb1\" spanTo=\"\\#pb2\"/&gt; ... &lt;/p&gt; \r\n&lt;p xml:id=\"para2\"&gt; ... &lt;pb n=\"2\" xml:id=\"pb2\" spanTo=\"\\#pb3\"/&gt; ... &lt;/p&gt; \r\n\r\ncould then be automatically processed into\r\n\r\n&lt;milestone unit=\"p\" xml:id=\"para1\" spanTo=\"\\#para2\"/&gt; ... \r\n&lt;page n=\"1\" xml:id=\"pb1\"&gt; ...  \r\n&lt;milestone unit=\"p\" xml:id=\"para2\" spanTo=\"\\#para3\"/&gt;\r\n&lt;/page&gt;\r\n&lt;page n=\"2\" xml:id=\"pb2\" spanTo=\"\\#pb3\"/&gt; \r\n&lt;milestone unit=\"p\" xml:id=\"para3\" spanTo=\"\\#para4\"/&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\nCost is that you have to have identifiers on everything. Concerns that\r\nthe spanning links only go in one direction could be addressed by\r\nextending att.spanning to provide additionally a @spanFrom attribute.\r\n\r\nCould also consider not using xml:id but ident/key co-reference. This\r\nwould effectively implement \"horse\".\r\n\r\n\r\n",

This would have the effect of forcing the encoder to put any of the other transcriptional markup \\*inside\\* one or other of the &lt;add&gt; and &lt;del&gt; elements. \r\n\r\nHowever  this is quite a major change from the current model, so I would appreciate any second thoughts from council members before implementing it.\r\n\r\nAnother thought: should this also allow &lt;addSpan&gt; and &lt;delSpan&gt; ?\r\n",

But it does have one \\(to my mind\\) highly undesirable side effect, of forcing semantically identical changes to be encoded differently. \\(I'm really only going to restate something noted in earlier comments by Elena and others.\\)\n\nConsider two authorial transformations in French:\n\n\\(1\\) un ch\u00e2teau ancien ==&gt; un ch\u00e2teau croulant  \\[\"crumbling\"\\]\n\n\\(2\\) un ch\u00e2teau ancien ==&gt; un vieux ch\u00e2teau\n\nIn each case, there is a deletion of the adjective \"ancien\" and the substitution of another adjective. Deep structure is identical, but in the case of \"vieux\" the surface-structure rules of French require a change in position of the adjective.\n\nUnder the proposal, these two substitutions \\*must\\* be encoded differently:\n\nun ch\u00e2teau &lt;subst&gt;&lt;del&gt;ancien&lt;/del&gt; &lt;add&gt;croulant&lt;/add&gt;&lt;subst&gt;\n\nun &lt;substJoin target=\"a1 d1\"/&gt;&lt;add xml:id=\"a1\"&gt;vieux&lt;/add&gt; ch\u00e2teau &lt;del xml:id=\"d1\"&gt;croulant&lt;/del&gt;\n\nThere are serious disadvantages to this: the encoding is more complicated, you can't take advantage of having a single XML element \\(&lt;subst&gt;\\) as a basis for rendering/indexing/processing, you can't handle or group the two kinds of cases together without a lot of extra back-end programming, etc.\n\nGranted the problem with allowing non-whitespace text as a child of &lt;subst&gt;, would it cause harm to allow &lt;seg&gt; as a child so that this would at least be possible? \n\nun &lt;subst&gt;&lt;add&gt;vieux&lt;/add&gt; &lt;seg&gt;ch\u00e2teau&lt;/seg&gt; &lt;del&gt;ancien&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/subst&gt;\n\n",

As for @target, URIs like \"/otherfile.xml\\#foo\" would be subject to xml:base, but \"\\#foo\" would refer to the current document, per the xml:base spec.  A @match used in conjunction with @target might point to a node in a different document in the former case, but I think this is fairly straightforward.  The point we want to argue for is that the default context should be the current certainty element rather than the current document root.  You can already use @target to reset the context, and presumably you could use it with @xml:base to reset it to a node in another document entirely.  I think defining the effects of xml:base in the guidelines should be the subject of another feature request.",

  "description": "I want to incorporate islands of distinct markup in a TEI document, in their own namespace. Unfortunately, one of the elements has the same name as an existing TEI one. If I pull in the external namespace as a RELAX NG schema, I can use a pattern prefix in the TEI to avoid the conflict, but this precludes making DTDs and getting integrated documentation, so I'd like to pull in \\(using XInclude\\) the external scheme using ODD \\(luckily, its already written in ODD\\). But now I cannot distinguish the external &lt;term&gt; from the TEI &lt;term&gt; \\(for it is this element which is the evil one\\).\r\n\r\nI'd like to get around this by making two changes to ODD:\r\na\\) add a \"prefix\" attribute to &lt;elementSpec&gt;, parallel to the one on &lt;schemaSpec&gt;, to allow us to determine the pattern name generated\r\nb\\) add a boolean attribute to &lt;content&gt; to determine whether references therein \\(RELAX NG &lt;ref&gt;\\) are able to be changed by having\r\nprefixes added automatically \\(as the TEI processor normally\\) does\r\n\r\nI am not 100% sure this is the most elegant solution, but I do think that we need to cater for this situation.",

DOWNSIDE - existing ODDS break, big time.\r\n\r\n2\\) allow for a @prefix attribute in various place to generate a prefix\r\nfor generated patterns, and allow use of that to distinguish \"condition\"\r\nfrom \"condition\". In this case, we have to know whether a name\r\ncontains a prefix, so we have to \\(eg\\) disallow \"-\" from names of things\r\nand use it as a prefix separator, or pick up a new character like &amp;middot;\r\nDOWNSIDE: messy and confusing.\r\n\r\n3\\) enhance the RELAX NG &lt;ref&gt; with a TEI-specific alternative supporting\r\na namespace declaration, and generate appropriate patterns\r\nat compile time. DOWNSIDE: we lose the ablity to validate\r\nthe contents of &lt;content&gt; against the RELAXNG schema\r\n\\]\r\n\r\nThe further suggestion was made of adding an extra attribute -- in the TEI namespace -- to the &lt;rng:ref&gt; element when this appears within the TEI &lt;content&gt; element e.gf.\r\n\r\n&lt;content&gt;\r\n&lt;rng:oneOrMore&gt;\r\n&lt;rng:ref name=\"blort\" tei:prefix=\"foo\"/&gt;\r\n&lt;/rng:oneOrMore&gt;\r\n&lt;/content&gt;\r\n\r\nDefault value would be set for @prefix depending on the @source from which the &lt;blort&gt; was being taken.\r\n\r\nThis seemed preferable to any of the others, if feasible.\r\n",

  "description": "There are three elements in TEI which are used to represent various parties responsible for a work:\r\n\r\nauthor\r\neditor\r\nrespStmt\r\n\r\nAccording to the definition of &lt;editor&gt;, it may take a role= attribute to indicate \"the nature of the intellectual responsibility\", with suggested values being:\r\n\r\ntranslator\r\neditor\r\ncompiler\r\nillustrator\r\n\r\nHowever, 3.11.2.2 says \"The author element should be used for the person or agency with primary responsibility for a work's intellectual content, and the element editor for an editor of the work.\"\r\n\r\nI do not consider translators, compilers, and illustrators to be compatible with 3.11.2.2, so I think this discrepancy should be clarified.\r\n\r\nAccording to Lou \\(at https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=2798963&group\\_id=106328&atid=644065 \\), author was meant for primary responsibility, editor for various types of secondary responsibility, and respStmt for anything else.  However, Council decided on 2009-12-07 to add @role to author to allow for distinguishing various types of authors.\r\n\r\nThe distinction among these three elements is problematic.  The TEI's ontology of entities responsible for a work is different from those used in other schemas \\(like the NLM DTDs for journals, as described in the ticket above, and in library cataloging practice, which does not attempt to distinguish types of responsibility\\), and it's not clear what purpose it serves to have three different elements when we can't agree on the semantics of them.\r\n\r\nI suggest we either prescribe use of these elements more carefully or remove author and editor in favor of the respStmt element, which would have an optional type=.  This attribute could be used by a project if a taxonomy of responsibilities is desired and if the various types of responsibility are not adequately conveyed by free text in resp.",

If &lt;ab&gt; is the general case, and &lt;p&gt; is syntactic sugar for &lt;ab @type=\"paragraph\"&gt;, while &lt;respStmt&gt; is the general case and &lt;author&gt; is syntactic sugar for &lt;respStmt&gt;&lt;resp&gt;author&lt;/resp&gt;&lt;/respStmt&gt; -- and I think there are many other such cases -- perhaps we should develop a general policy with regard to the class membership and attribute availability for such syntactic sugar elements. It would also help to see an exhaustive list of such elements -- does one exist?",

A translator, illustrator, or\r\ncompiler, may however be marked by means of the &lt;gi&gt;editor&lt;/gi&gt; element,\r\noptionally using the &lt;att&gt;role&lt;/att&gt; attribute to specify the nature\r\nof their responsibility more exactly.\r\n\r\nThe reason for having the three different elements, as Martin notes, is to make life a bit easier for simple uses. I think there is a good case to be made for recommending only a subset of what the TEI provides in specific contexts, but that's often the case. \r\n\r\n",

However, without a generic normalization attribute for non-Gregorian dates it becomes messy to sort dates.  &lt;orig&gt; and &lt;reg&gt; could do it, but are always going to be implementation-specific and are hardly elegant for such a potentially very common task.\r\n\r\nI am proposing a general-purpose solution which would provide a very broad range of functionality as described by example below, and which would require a new attribute class under att.datable as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\natt.datable.generic\r\n\r\n@datingPoint  \\[data.pointer, optional\\]\r\nsupplies a pointer to some location defining a named point in time with reference to which the datable item is understood to have occurred. \\[e.g., points to a taxonomy/category or event.\\]\r\n\r\n@datingMethod  \\[data.pointer, optional\\]\r\nsupplies a pointer to some location defining a calendrical system or other means of interpreting the value of @when-generic, @notBefore-generic, @notAfter-generic, @from-generic or @to-generic \\(possibly with respect to @datingPoint\\).\r\n\r\n@period       \\[Identical to the attribute in att.datable.w3c.\\]\r\n\r\n@when-generic, @notBefore-generic, @notAfter-generic, @from-generic, @to-generic  \\[data.word, optional\\]\r\nsupplies the value of the date or time in a standard form, e.g. yyyy-mm-dd, which can be an absolute or relative value depending on the presence of the other attributes.\r\n\r\nSome examples:\r\n\r\n&lt;date when-generic=\"0027\" datingPoint=\"\\#RamesesII\" datingMethod=\"\\#Egyptian365\"&gt;27 years into the reign of Rameses II, counting in the Egyptian 365-day calendar&lt;/date&gt;\r\n\r\nOn the &lt;date when-generic=\"5\" datingPoint=\"\\#ArabianNights\"&gt;5th night&lt;/date&gt;, Scheherazade told another story...\r\n\r\n&lt;date when-generic=\"1590-02-20\" datingMethod=\"\\#JulianOS\"&gt;The 20th Feb 1590 \\(old style\\)&lt;/date&gt; is &lt;date when-generic=\"1591-02-20\" datingMethod=\"\\#JulianNS\"&gt;the 20th Feb 1591 \\(new style\\)&lt;/date&gt; in the Julian Calendar, according to the English custom.\r\n\r\nWe aim to sight land on the &lt;date when-generic=\"35\" datingPoint=\"\\#sailedSierraLeone\" datingMethod=\"\\#TravelItinerary\"&gt;35th day&lt;/date&gt;.\r\n\r\nIn the last example, the targets of @datingPoint and @datingMethod might be as follows:\r\n\r\n&lt;taxonomy xml:id=\"dating\"&gt;\r\n&lt;category xml:id=\"TravelItinerary\"&gt;\r\n&lt;gloss&gt;@when-generic indicates the number of days as an integer.&lt;/gloss&gt;\r\n&lt;/category&gt;\r\n&lt;/taxonomy&gt;\r\n...\r\n&lt;person xml:id=\"RevRichardMadox\"&gt;\r\n&lt;event xml:id=\"sailedSierraLeone\" when-generic=\"193\" datingPoint=\"\\#sailedSouthampton\" datingMethod=\"\\#TravelItinerary\"&gt;&lt;label&gt;sailed from Sierra Leone&lt;/label&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was 193 days after leaving Southampton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/event&gt;\r\n...\r\n&lt;event xml:id=\"sailedSouthampton\" when-iso=\"1582-01-01\"&gt;&lt;label&gt;sailed from Southampton&lt;/label&gt;&lt;/event&gt;\r\n&lt;/person&gt;\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above class att.datable.generic, it would be greatly advantageous if @calendar were available as part of att.datable.  Currently, it is only available for &lt;date&gt;, although there seems no reason why this should be the case.  It should be emphasized that it specifies the calendar system of the text within the given element rather than that of the attributes of the @when genus, to avoid confusion; however, in the absence of @datingPoint and @datingMethod it could, by convention, indicate the calendrical system used by @when-generic, e.g.\r\n&lt;date when=\"1499-12-23\" when-generic=\"1500-01-01\" calendar=\"Julian\"&gt;1st Jan 1500&lt;/date&gt;\r\n&lt;date when=\"1499-12-23\" when-generic=\"905 Jumada i-Ula 11\" calendar=\"Islamic\"&gt;905 Jumada i-Ula 11&lt;/date&gt;\r\n\r\nAs an aside, after discussion in the TEI-MS-SIG List, it seems likely that some people are currently using @when for Julian dates without realising that they are meant for Gregorian dates.  It would be helpful to specify this in the attribute &lt;desc&gt;, which is currently rather misleading.  Alternatively, @when might be renamed @when-w3c.",

        "text": "My initial reaction to this is positive, and it would provide a potential solution to a problem we've been facing with regard to integrating vague, but \"real\", dates of events in the ancient world, and equally vague, but fictional, dates of mythological events. In particular, we have noted inconsistent chronologies \\(where event A is reported to have happened before event B, and event B before event C, while another source, or even the same one, specifies C as having happened before A. \n\nHowever, I'm not really sure I understand exactly how @when-generic and its friends are supposed to work. It can be relative or absolute -- which is excellent, and would cover the above scenario by allowing us to specify dates of events relative to each other, without worrying about whether there are logical inconsistencies -- but I'm not sure how to express these relationships. Would the content of @when-generic be constrained in some way, or would its content form be documented somewhere else? I could imagine using &lt;date notAfter-generic=\"\\#eventADate\" notBefore=\"\\#eventBDate\"&gt; to specify the date relationship for event C; I could also imagine relative time periods \\(the day after, a month before\\) and so on. Would the usage of @\\*-generic be documented in the &lt;event&gt; element pointed to by @dating-point?",

My scheme as currently outlined allows for one free-text \"date\" \\(i.e., @datingPoint\\) and one or more \\*numerical\\* offsets, so what you suggest is a departure, but I don't see why you couldn't use pointers, and even though it's pretty self-explanatory you could and probably ought to describe what you're doing with @datingMethod \\(not @datingPoint\\), so it might look like this:\r\n\r\n&lt;event xml:id=\"eventC\" notAfter-generic=\"\\#eventA\" notBefore=\"\\#eventB\" @datingMethod=\"\\#describeUseOfPointersIfPedantic\"&gt;\r\n\r\nHowever, I suspect the semantic purists might object to the dual use of @\\*-generic as both number/word-like and pointer-like.  It would be pretty handy though.\r\n\r\nThe use of pointers in @\\*-generic would be mutually exclusive to the use of @datingPoint \\(since pointers point to definitions of dates that are by nature \"atomic\", and therefore don't relate to @datingPoint\\), which is perhaps more of an issue, but this could be explained in the Guidelines I suppose.",

        "text": "When the current facilities for date normalization were discussed, it was agreed that the TEI should offer just one way of normalizing dates, and that this should be based on existing standards. There was dome debate \\(which continues\\) about whether we should adopt the full range of date representations provided by ISO 8601 or just the subset of that implemented by W3C. The decision was to support both; so we have both \\(e.g\\). @when-w3c and @when-iso. To make life easier, we define  @when as equivalen to t @when-w3c rather than @when-iso \\(though some folks would like us to rethink that\\). Note that in either case though, we're talking about \\*representations\\* of date/time values in  a single calendar. These attributes won't help you express the arcana of other calendar systems; it's not what they're for. They express points in time using just one method, and that's all they aim to do. So yes, if you want to express  normalised versions of your non-Gregorian dates you will either have to work out how to convert them into Gregorian dates \\(not always as difficult as all that\\), or you will have to propose another method of normalizing them. If you take the former approach, you can still structure your date internally using whatever method you care to invent in order to show that this date in the XXX calendar is the fourth Skramaloon of the Fifteenth Dingbat in the year of the dog \\(if that';s your bag\\) , but you can now compare that date with other events using other calendars \\(\"is this date before or after the 124th July 1789\"\\). Which is the purpose of normalization. Alternatively, if you take the other approach, your encoding may well look a lot simpler, but now you can do date comparisons only with other Dingbat lovers,  \r\n\r\nSo, I think there's a lot to be said for discussing how we might organize the internal structure of a date in a non-Gregorian calendar, but I think that should be done quite independently of the question of how that date value should be normalised. For better or worse, we measure normalised times in terms of the Gregorian calendar, just as we measure space using  the metric system and inventing another way would be, in my opinion, an otiose and retrograde step.\r\n",

Our final proposal is below, following a report on the discussion we had.\n\nWe discussed the possibility that we might need to distinguish between \"standard\" dating systems \\(such as the Islamic calendar\\) and \"fictional\" systems \\(such as the Star Trek calendar\\), but decided that this is not a meaningful distinction; all calendar systems are essentially fictional.\n\nWe discussed the proposal by Lou that all of this should be handled through the creation of a specialized element, but determined that this would be inadequate, because the requirement is to supply custom dating features for all the elements in att.datable, and to allow these to co-exist beside standardized dates expressed using the existing attributes.\n\nTherefore we believe that there is a need for these attributes. However, we are unhappy with the use of \"generic\", since we believe this would be misleading; we would prefer \"custom\", because this would tend to discourage the accidental use of these attributes by someone who didn't really understand the difference between the various sets of dating attributes.\n\nWe like the @datingPoint and @datingMethod, as data.pointer, and suggest that the latter could be used \\(and should probably be shown in the guidelines\\) to point to the &lt;calendarDesc&gt; element which will probably arise out of ticket \\#2994671.\n\nSo:\n\nThe following attribute class should be created:\n\natt.datable.custom\n\nIt should be added to att.datable, alongside att.datable.w3c and att.datable.iso.\n\nThe following optional attributes should be added to the class, with a datatype of 1-to-infinity of data.word:\n\n@when-custom\n@from-custom\n@to-custom\n@notBefore-custom\n@notAfter-custom\n\nThe following optional attributes should be added to the class, with a datatype of data.pointer:\n\n@datingPoint\n@datingMethod\n\nIn addition:\n\n@calendar should be moved from att.date to att.datable.\n@period should be moved from att.datable.w3c to att.datable.\n\nFinally, a new section needs to be added to the Guidelines to explain the use of these attributes. This can only be accomplished once action has also been taken on ticket \\#2994671 \\(&lt;calendarDesc&gt;\\). In the meantime, we should be collecting some plausible and real examples that demonstrate the variety of possible uses, building on what the submitter has already provided. I would suggest that we include examples from the Islamic calendar, at least one ancient calendar \\(Egyptian?\\), one Julian \\(preferably one not easily normalized to Gregorian\\), and one more obviously fictional \\(Star Trek?\\).\n",

If you enter a paragraph of text \\(in a &lt;p&gt;\\) with no other markup, then the spaces within that paragraph are a significant part of your data, denoting word-breaks etc. Once you start putting several layers of transcriptional markup in that paragraph \\(abbreviations, restorations, corrections, regulartizations, reference strings, unclear characters, and all sorts of other sub-word or cross-word tags\\) then an XML parser starts to have a hard time understanding which elements should have whitespace between them and which shouldn't. If the XML is composed and structured entirely by hand, then I can put in carriage returns \\(and spaces, tabs, etc.\\) at harmless points to make the text readable in Oxygen on my portrait screen, say. Harmless in this case means that when I render these complex tags into a txt or HTML format using Leiden conventions, a word containing restoration and abbreviation displays correctly as \"Im\\[p\\]\\(erator\\)\", without interpolated spaces such as \"Im\\[p\\] \\(erator\\)\". \\(And, conversely, that spaces between words are preserved and not assumed to be empty nodes.\\)\r\n\r\nBut as soon as an XML-aware process is performed on this file, such as an XSLT identity transform, or even just pressing pretty-print in Oxygen, this text is no longer harmless. Line breaks may be inserted between adjacent elements \\(like the &lt;supplied&gt; and &lt;ex&gt; in the example above\\), and so forth. Sometimes a file is going to be edited by hand in Oxygen, and so having the XML in one long line \\(after an identity transform with @indent=\"no\"\\) is a serious blight.\r\n\r\nSo far, putting xml:space on this one div containing the text has been the only thing we have found that makes this problem bearable.",

Among reasons proposed for dropping it were primarily inapplicability \\(there are many elements on which it would never be used e.g. empty ones, or header ones\\); that it is about output processing only; that its semantics are not well defined and often misunderstood. There being reluctance to contemplate the overhead of defining and maintaining a non-global class, and there being plenty of evidence that the attribute was useful for some relevant purposes, it was agreed to reinstate it, for simplicity, and to add wording to the relevant section of DS to make clear how it should \\(and should not\\) be used.\r\n\r\n",

No attempt is made to delimit the various parties listed or categorize them by role, so the way the TEI distinguishes &lt;author&gt;, &lt;editor&gt;, &lt;meeting&gt;, &lt;principal&gt;, &lt;respStmt&gt;, and &lt;sponsor&gt; doesn't map to this information.\n\nb\\) They record certain responsible parties in standardized name forms \\(in forms such as \"Shakespeare, William, 1564-1616\"\\) to allow you to find all works by a given author in a catalog.  Given many parties listed, there are rules to determine which entities are important enough to warrant this kind of treatment.  Such responsible parties are distinguished as personal names, corporate names \\(a university, a business, an anarchist group\\), or the name of a meeting.  These don't map well to &lt;author&gt;, &lt;editor&gt;, and &lt;meeting&gt; -- not only because of the form of the name has things like dates in it but also because the ontology is a bit different.\n\nc\\) They transcribe from the title page \\(or its digital equivalent\\) all information about the name\\(s\\) of publishing, distributing, releasing, and issuing activities.

I also notice that the actual change we agreed to \\(add &lt;distributor&gt; to model.respLike\\) was actually only a preliminary step in a proposed method of making the following elements:\r\n\r\n&lt;principal&gt;\r\n&lt;funder&gt;\r\n&lt;sponsor&gt;\r\n\r\navailable in &lt;analytic&gt;, &lt;monogr&gt; and &lt;series&gt;.

I think the following things:\r\n\r\n1\\. &lt;distributor&gt; does belong in model.respLike, along with &lt;principal&gt; et al., but there's no way to get it there without making significant structural changes. \\(Meanwhile, Kevin believes that neither &lt;distributor&gt; nor &lt;funder&gt; should be in model.respLike anyway.\\)\r\n\r\n2\\. model.respLike does belong in &lt;analytic&gt; et al., but council doesn't think so, and in any case this would be hard to achieve.\r\n\r\n3\\. The content model of &lt;biblStruct&gt; and its children is a big mess, largely due to historical factors and subsequent tinkering, and the only way to deal with it will be to start from scratch, with a more logical set of model classes. This would inevitably break the Birnbaum doctrine.\r\n\r\nSo I am closing this ticket without action, since I opened it in the first place, and only Kevin, Lou and I seem to care about it. ",

However, I don't think the proposal as it stands is very persuasive: sorting of &lt;bibl&gt; entries is an application specific process -- you might want to produce a list ordered by title, or author, or subject, or any number of other keys, deriving them all from the same set of bibls  so why should the bibl itself dictate to you what its  sort key should be?  What is the use case? I can see why you might want to specify a normalised value on e.g. author or title, but that is already possible.  Your sorting procedure needs to be sophisticated enough to deal with missing cases, iI agree.",

It would, of course, be perhaps better if this was just declared somewhere generally and we say for sorting purposes all '\u00e4' should be treated as 'a'.

Going back to the bad old days of supplying effectively ascii transcriptions to provide sort keys is ignoring our commitment to Unicode.

With born-digital documents, or where TEI is being used as a way to store and manipulate information that's subject to regular changes and updates, there's definitely a need for something like this. For instance, imagine a large and growing bibliography, which has complex &lt;biblFull&gt;s or &lt;biblStruct&gt;s. You're adding new stuff to this all the time, and providing a feed on a web site somewhere which has the biblio sorted according to \\(say\\) some standard such as MLA. Sometimes items have authors and need to be sorted by them; sometimes editors; sometimes there are no such elements, and sorting needs to be done by title, or by website name, or by something else. You don't want to be trying to maintain complicated XSLT that needs to be regularly updated to try to figure out what element should be used as the sort key, nor do you want the burden of having to sort the items manually whenever adding new content or editing the list. A sort key is perfect for this scenario.\n\nIf the user then wants to sort by some other principle, then either providing access to the XML or rendering it into a table with clickable column heads will of course allow this; but the default sort order specified by the author\\(s\\) of the bibliography can be done most simply and sensibly with a sort key, IMHO.",

        "text": "There are a few different types of sorting that we need to distinguish:\n\nA\\) Given strings of characters, how do you sort these?  People sometimes rely on the codepoints in a character encoding, but even if we use Unicode codepoints, we must acknowledge that there is no universal way to sort characters in a given script.  \\(Do you sort \"a with an umlaut\" with As or after Z?\\)  Practice varies by language, by country, and possibly by publication or catalog \\(e.g., when producing a bibliography, you might choose to interfile Latin and Cyrillic names or have all Latin followed by all Cyrillic.\\)  See http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr10/ .  To me, @sortKey does not really help with this.\n\nB\\) Given certain lexical items, do you ignore the usual sorting rules?  Do you ignore initial articles in titles and in surnames containing articles?  Do you file \"McDonnell and \"MacDonnell\" the same and interfile \"San\", \"Santo\", and \"Santa\"?  See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collation\\#Alphabetical\\_order .  There is no clear division between this and \\(A\\) since there are borderlien cases \\(like hyphens and spaces\\) which are not clearly case of \\(A\\) or \\(B\\).  To me, @sortKey has the potential to help here, though using it means you are imposing your desired sorting order on the encoded text.\n\nC\\) Given a bunch of personal names such as \"Matilde Barroca Rahtz\" where you want to produce an alphabetical list of names, do you file under \"Rahtz\" or \"Barroca\"?  Practice here varies by language, by country \\(and within countries\\), and possibly by publication or catalog.  The same name may be treated differently in different countries -- not just because of cultural ignorance but intentionally.  See http://wikis.ala.org/professionaltips/index.php/Filing\\_rules .  To impose your desired sorting order, you could use @sortKey on a bibl/biblStruct/biblFull \\(assuming that citations are only to be sorted by name\\) or on an &lt;author&gt; \\(if the name components have not been tagged but you want to allow sorting by name\\).\n\nD\\) Given a bunch of bibliographi citations, should you file them under the name of an author, editor, of the title \\(when no author or editor is given\\).  This depends first on what components of the bibliographic citation are present and second on the practice of that publication or catalog.  You could impose your desired order with @sortKey on bibl/biblStruct/biblFull.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nIf you're encoding a source document, you are probably content to keep the order of citations or names given there.  However, if you are using TEI to store names or bibliographic citations for output in various formats or to be sorted by the user in various ways, you might want to use something like @sortKey to help a sorting algorithm.  By doing so, you would end up imposing your way of sorting, but maybe this is exactly what you want to do.  If you were going to impose a single way to sort citations, you would put this attribute on bibl/biblStruct/biblFull'.\n\nOn the other hand, if you know citations will be sorted in various ways and you want to give instructions on how to sort by author and title \\(when these are present in a citation\\), you would want to be able to provide sort instructions on &lt;author&gt;, &lt;editor&gt;, and &lt;title&gt; \\(yet also have processing instructions that know what to do when an author or editor is absent\\).  Maybe, instead of using author@key and editor@key \\(as some people do to handle this\\), we should add @sortKey to &lt;author&gt;, &lt;editor&gt;, and &lt;title&gt; in addition to &lt;bibl&gt;, &lt;biblStruct&gt;, and &lt;biblFull&gt;?",

  "description": "Hi,\r\nthis is just a request to allow more markup to come through on the div headings and numbering to make it a bit easier to manipulate the CSS stylesheets.\r\n\r\n1\\. Currently the numbering is just concatenated with the &lt;head&gt; info into a single &lt;h..&gt; tag which makes it hard to pick out the number to construct fancier headings with the stylesheet. e.g. having the each chapter \\(in a more traditional text\\) headed with something like \"Chapter 1\" in one font size and style and the actual heading in a different style.\r\n\r\n2\\. The concatenation behaviour also makes it difficult to markup and style div headings that have a more complex structure. For instance I've been marking up a text in which for the most part each chapter has a single title but there are a couple which are quotes followed by the name of the individual source of the quote. In the original print edition the source was set in smaller type beneath the quote. In my original markup I had used to &lt;head&gt; tags one set as type=\"sub\". In the output this becomes concatenated into a single tag and you can't separate the sources name. In an attempt to get around this I resorted to \\(what is probably better markup\\) placing a &lt;quote&gt; and &lt;bibl&gt; tag inside the &lt;head&gt; tag like:\r\n\r\n&lt;head&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;And I Came into the Fields and Wide Palaces of Memory&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;bibl&gt;&lt;name&gt;St Augustine&lt;/name&gt;&lt;/bibl&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/head&gt;\r\n\r\nunfortunately all the markup was stripped out of the heading so I'm not able to get to it with a style sheet.\r\n\r\n3\\. It doesn't appear to be possible to have a &lt;div&gt; without a heading. The script cleverly tries to construct one using the the type=\"\" tag or failing that out puts the tag name i.e. \"div\" as the title. I've tried adding empty &lt;head&gt; tags but this doesn't work. There are some structures where you need to suppress the title, I'm not sure whether this is a problem with the way OxygenXML interprets the \"teilite.rng\" file but you need to use unheaded &lt;div&gt; tags to work around the fact that you can't have &lt;p&gt; tags after and embedded &lt;div&gt; e.g.\r\n\r\n&lt;div type=\"chapter\"&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;introduction and commentary&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;div type=\"letter\"&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;content&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;this tag which might contain summarizing commentary is not allowed...&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;div&gt; \r\n&lt;p&gt;it has to be embedded like this&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\nIn this case you don't want a heading. in the final div tag.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nGary",

In the case under review, there is a strong  -- presumably \"scholarly\" -- view in some quarters that it should be possible to express the value of a feature without taking a stand as to its datatype; the fact that in practice this means that the \"untyped\" value is actually the same as \"string\" cuts no ice with that theoretical point of view. It's not just a matter of convenience: it's meeting a principled objection. I apologise for not having presented the arguments in favour of this change more clearly or more thoroughly, but I think the case is a good one. Pragmatically speaking, it would also facilitate take up of the TEI within some quarters of the language processing community, if we care about that. ",

Indeed this seems to be a welcome step towards NLP/CL communities.\n\nUsage scenarios could probably be dug up in or constructed from, Andreas Witt et al.'s papers on susTEInability and similar topics.

However, since Tite is designed for use by vendors and discusses things such as accuracy of keyboarding, I believe it would also be appropriate for Tite to discuss things that can affect the number of characters used in the encoding: namely, the use of namespaces for TEI elements.  Since vendors often charge by the byte, the size of the file can vary greatly depending on where and how namespaces are specified.  To me the most sensible way to enforce uniformity and keep the byte count to a minimum is to require a vendor to use the DTD, not one of the various schema formats, avoiding namespaces entirely.\r\n\r\nYou might say this is something for a vendor and customer to negotiate, but the point of Tite is to provide something ready to use for customers and vendors who don't want to have to go through all of this on their own.",

  "description": "Section 4.3.2 \\(\\#DSFLT\\) discusses floating texts and gives an example of a frame story that contains stories within the frame story.  This seems to me to be different from a situation where the frame story \\*quotes\\* a whole text.  I bring this up because this section ends with the following: \"The floatingText element should only be used for complete texts which form a part of the text being encoded. Where a character in one narrative quotes from some other text or narrative, fully or in part, the quote  element discussed in 3.3.3 Quotation  should be used instead.\"  I read this as saying that, if you quote an entire text, you should not use &lt;quote&gt; with a nested &lt;floatingText&gt; element but use only &lt;quote&gt;.  It seems to me that it would be ontologically correct to include both &lt;quote&gt; and the nested &lt;floatingText&gt;, even in the examples given -- after all, a character in one narrative quotes from some other text or narrative, no?\r\n\r\nAn additional reason to make it clear that you should use &lt;quote&gt;&lt;floatingText&gt; even when quoting entire texts is that, if you use only &lt;quote&gt; \\(as above\\), you are limited by the content model of &lt;quote&gt; in what structure you can tag within the quoted passage.",

Since it's not clear whether \"the inclusion\" refers to &lt;floatingText&gt; or a floating text, let's go with Lou's version but keep \"simply\" since this is the most basic and common type of floating text and since it makes the sentence easier to read.

That was after all one of the purposes of the changes made for release 1.9 \r\n\r\nIn response to Kevin's comment on the ticket: there is a big difference between pb@facs and graphic@url -- the latter means that there is an image here which forms \\*part of the text\\* -- the former means that there is an image of this part of the text here, but it is not a textual constituent.\r\n\r\nI'm also a bit surprised to learn that data capture agencies want to use this feature: are they going to be supplying page images too?

Crucially, such items are at the same hierarchic level as the speeches which precede and follow them. The proposal is to define a new &lt;spGrp&gt; element which would stand in more or less the same relation to &lt;sp&gt; as does &lt;lg&gt; to &lt;l&gt; : it would be a member of model.divPart, and have a content model, and have the same content model as &lt;sp&gt;\r\n\r\n",

One of the benefits of this is it allows the presentation of quite a full example, but an initial display that is less threatening, and then as the user reads through information about the example, they can expand/collapse other parts of it.  Just making the decision on the processing-for-presentation side of things becomes immensely difficult without something in the source saying 'keep this one showing' and 'hide this one and its children', etc.  \r\n\r\nThis is, you are right, a completely separate issue from the validation of the examples \\(just came up as a result of discussing possible ways to solve it\\).\r\n\r\n-James",

        "text": "When we were examining this ticket at the Council F2F meeting, we felt a little confused by the wording of the description of the values for @valid as they currently appear in the guidelines. First of all, egXML is identified as containing an XML fragment. An XML fragment is a section of an XML document which is considered \"well balanced\":\n\n\"A region \\(consecutive sequence of characters\\) of an XML document is said to be \\(well-\\)balanced if it matches production \\[43\\] content of \\[XML 1.0\\]. Informally this means that, if the region includes any part of the markup of any construct, it contains all of the markup of that construct \\(e.g., in the case of elements, all of both the start and end tag\\).\"\n\nhttp://www.w3.org/TR/xml-fragment.html\\#terminology\n\nThis implies that an XML fragment may consist of a pair or a group of siblings, not necessarily a single hierarchy rooted on one element. However, the subsequent definitions of @valid=\"true\" and @valid=\"feasible\" seem to require that a fragment in &lt;egXML&gt; be rooted on a single element, in order that it may be validated using a manipulated schema which is rooted on that element. If this is indeed the import of @valid, then the word \"fragment\", which in XML has a broader meaning than is intended here, should be removed from, or qualified in, the definition of &lt;egXML&gt;.\n\nIn addition to this, we believe two of the three value definitions could be clarified. Specifically&gt;:\n\n\"true: \nthe example is intended to be fully valid, assuming that its root element can be used as the root element in the schema concerned. \\[Default\\]\"\n\nThe use of \"can\" here implies that a TEI schema can be rooted on any TEI element \\(such as for example &lt;p&gt;\\). This is not the case in a standard TEI schema, so the language should reflect that this is a hypothetical condition, by the use of \"could\" or \"were able to\" instead of \"can\".\n\n\n\"feasible:\nthe example could be transformed into a valid document by inserting any number of valid attributes and child elements anywhere within it; it is valid against a version of the schema concerned in which every data, list, element, or attribute element has been made optional.\"\n\nHere our problems are with two phrases which we don't understand: \"every data\", and \"attribute element\". We suspect \"attribute element\" should simply read \"attribute\", but we don't actually know what is intended by \"every data\".",

This is equivalent to transforming the schema by wrapping every data, list, element and attribute element in an optional element and then validating against the transformed schema.\" \r\n\r\nWhat cutting and pasting obscures is that the words  \"data\",\" list\", \"element\", \"attribute\" and \"optional\" are typographically distinct: they are actually element names in the RelaxNG schema being validated. One hesitates to improve on James Clark's language but maybe the following is less confusing:\r\n\r\n\"This is equivalent to validating the document against a version of its schema which has been transformed by wrapping every data, list, element and attribute element it contains in an optional element\"\r\n\r\n\r\n",

My belief is that was originally invented as a way of providing \"added entries\" for titles/authors/ etc. of works otherwise unidentifiable within the work being catalogued. Extra access points that is. In a blog or digital file, however, the individual entries are already individully accessible: they are thus monographic rather than analytic. Where the analogy breaks down is that we can't then treat the whole blog itself as a monographic entry. Maybe that should be an analytic, or a series titles?  Apologies if this seems unduly pedantic, or has already been discussed to death. I note btw that you can already put &lt;date&gt; inside &lt;title&gt;\r\n",

In current practice, &lt;analytic&gt; is used for journal articles and book chapters, with their host issues or books handled in the associated &lt;monogr&gt;, and the \\(heretofore reasonable\\) implication is that chapters and articles inherit their dates from their containing object. The guidelines themselves say \"&lt;analytic&gt; \\(analytic level\\) contains bibliographic elements describing an item \\(e.g. an article or poem\\) published within a monograph or journal and not as an independent publication.\" Now we have contained objects which do \\_not\\_ inherit their date from the container \\(blog posts, etc.\\), so they need their own date. I'd say that blog posts are manifestly not standalone monographic objects; they're published all together in one location, in series, like a diary.\r\n\r\nI think the argument is strong here, but if you disagree, then I think it's another nail in the coffin of &lt;biblStruct&gt; from my point of view. When you can't actually use &lt;biblStruct&gt; to encode what you believe in good faith to be \"true\" about real-life bibliographical items -- in this case, that contained objects may have a date which is independent of their container -- then the construct becomes simply tyrannical, and nobody is going to want to use it. I've already migrated my more recent projects to &lt;bibl&gt; instead because of these limitations. ",

On the other hand, &lt;monogr&gt; is used for metadata about things for which, in most citation formats, the title is given in italics.

MH, LR: LB's use-case is actually a use-case for &lt;idno&gt; , not for &lt;ident&gt; . For instance, he uses URLs and filenames, and both of these should be &lt;idno&gt; . However, &lt;idno&gt; also does not permit internal structure, and there are other use-cases where that would be a good idea \\(for instance ISBNs and ISSNs\\). At the same time, &lt;ident&gt; does have a specific purpose, which is tagging formal identifiers in e.g. programming languages, and these do not typically have internal structure. Finally, we are sympathetic to Sebastian's objections related to processing. Therefore we propose that &lt;idno&gt; should be made recursive, allowing internal structure, examples of recursive &lt;idno&gt; should be supplied, and LB should be encouraged to use &lt;idno&gt; instead of &lt;ident&gt; for his purposes. EP strongly objected that the subdivisions of &lt;idno&gt; are not necessarily &lt;idno&gt;s. LB says that the difference between &lt;ident&gt; and &lt;idno&gt; definitely needs some clarification. Assigned to MH to clarify the guidelines on the difference between &lt;idno&gt; and &lt;ident&gt;, and close the ticket, and to LR to raise a new ticket for the nesting of &lt;idno&gt; so the council can address it at length. \r\n\\[/minutes\\]\r\n\r\nAfter discussion, though, we seem to be a long way from a consensus, in that most people haven't expressed a view, and those of us that have seem to fall into two main camps: those who believe that &lt;ident&gt; and &lt;idno&gt; overlap substantially, and those who would like them not to, and want to word the guidelines accordingly.\r\n\r\nHowever, nobody has actually objected to the wording that I proposed adding to the existing element definitions:\r\n\r\n\\----------\r\n&lt;ident&gt; should be used for tokens such as variable names, class names, \r\ntype names, function names etc. in formal programming languages. \\(It \r\nshould not be used for element and attribute names in XML, for which the special elements &lt;gi&gt; and &lt;att&gt; are provided.\\)\r\n\r\n&lt;idno&gt; should be used for labels which uniquely identify an object or \r\nconcept in a formal cataloguing system such as a database or an RDF \r\nstore, or in a distributed system such as the World Wide Web.\r\n\\----------\r\n\r\nSo unless someone does voice a spirited objection in the next little while, I propose adding those to the two &lt;elementSpec&gt;s. That pushes us oh-so-gently in the direction of making more of a distinction between the use-cases for the two elements. I'm then going to look at the text of these two sections:\r\n\r\n&lt;http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/CO.html\\#COBICOI&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/TD.html\\#TDphrase&gt;\r\n\r\nto see if further disambiguation is possible or desirable in the text.

  "description": "gramGrp serves to encode grammatical information about a lexical item. It may self-nest, thus providing containers for various feature groups.\r\n\r\nBy its nature, gramGrp appears to be a near-equivalent of a feature structure \\(&lt;fs&gt;\\). If it were to be fully equivalent to &lt;fs&gt;, it should get the additional \"attribute type \\{ data.enumerated \\}?\", because feature structures can be typed. However, full equivalence to an &lt;fs&gt; would also mean equivalent nesting, but that may not be realistic in dictionary entries, and therefore it seems appropriate to give the encoder both @type and @subtype at his disposal, so that these two attributes may be used to express both the type of a feature structure and, in a shorthand way, the information that would normally be read from the hierarchy of a feature structure tree.\r\n\r\nSaying this, I have in mind HPSG-like robust feature structures, where containers identified as &lt;fs type=\"agr\"&gt; may express, among others, \r\na\\) the agreement features that are property of the lexical item being described -- at one, shallow, level of nesting, and, \\*at the same time\\*\r\nb\\) the agreement features of an element that is, e.g., the obligatory complement of the lexical item in question, and thus the &lt;fs type=\"agr\"&gt; is buried deep in the feature structure hierarchy.\r\n\r\n\\[I tried to find an example readable as HTML, but failed. Instead, these slides can give an idea of what I'm talking about:\r\nhttp://jones.ling.indiana.edu/~mdickinson/08/614/slides/hpsg-slides.pdf\r\nsee slide 11 for a simple example of types repeated in a nesting structure, and slide 63 for something more extreme; I'm not sure I can attach them \\(there's no licensing info there\\) but I'll keep a copy in case they vanish from the Net\\]\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of a dictionary/lexical database, full isomorphy between \"true\" feature structures and gramGrp would be absolute overkill \\(compare the slides\\), and in the case at hand could be replaced with, e.g., &lt;gramGrp type=\"agr\" subtype=\"head\"&gt; followed by &lt;gramGrp type=\"agr\" subtype=\"complement\"&gt;.\r\n\r\nThere are various types of gramGrp that can be thought of, depending on the grammatical model and the lexicographic principles assumed. Therefore, I'd rather not enumerate the possible values of these attributes, delegating the task of creating such a mini-ontology to the encoder.\r\n",

        "text": "Let me also take this one level down, to actual lexicographic practice. The first time I saw the need for typing gramGrp was when preparing a dictionary of Swahili, where in some cases you have to distinguish between the morphological aspect of noun class \\(if it bears the morphology -- and typically corresponds to the default semantic type -- of class C, then the plural should be formed in class D\\) and its syntactic aspect \\(normally, class C triggers \"C-agreement\" in verbs and adjectives, but if a C-class noun happens to be animate, it triggers \"A-agreement\", although the plural is formed in class D still\\). So we need to refer to two types of class features at the same time, to handle the morphological aspect \\(plural formation\\) and the morphosyntactic aspect \\(agreement\\). This is why dictionaries of Swahili may seem messy to an outsider, because they either focus on one or on the other. \\(And the picture gets even more complicated when we include agreement with possessive pronouns in it.\\)\n\nThis isn't exclusive to Swahili. Another quick simplified example from Polish that I can think of is where some feminine nouns \\(e.g. mo\u015b\u0107 'highness'\\) trigger \"grammatical\" feminine agreement but sometimes also semantic masculine agreement \\(if they denote males\\), the result being:\n\nhis\\(masc\\) royal\\(fem.\\) highness\\(fem./masc\\) looked-around\\(masc.\\)\n\nAnd my point is, to repeat: being able to type &lt;gramGrp&gt; would be a relief in such cases, because you definitely want to keep the two &lt;gen&gt; specifications in separate &lt;gramGrp&gt;s, and then you want to know which &lt;gramGrp&gt; pertains to which aspects of the realisation of the word in question.",

But it is not uncommon for a postscript to be a microversion of the letter to which it is appended, with some form of \"Dear Sir\" and some form of \"Sincerely yours, John Smith.\"  Opener and closer elements would be welcome. Right now you would either have to downshift the encoding to &lt;ab&gt; or turn a more complex postscript into floatingText. Neither of these is an attractive solution. ",

        "text": "I see the force of this argument, but it's an even stronger argument for not having postscript in the first place. \"postscript\" is a part of \"letter\", and if there is no letter tag why should there be a postscript. So there would be a logic to using &lt;ab&gt; for simple cases and &lt;div&gt; for more complex cases. In the EEBO collection there are things called postscript that are whole treatises, and whatever is the right way of encoding them, &lt;postscript&gt; is not it. \n\nOn the other hand, once you have &lt;postscript&gt;, it's hard not to notice that even short ones are full of openers and closers, salutations, and signatures. So it seems to me that the current content rules for postscript are stuck in an uncomfortable middle, and it might be better either to move back or forward. \n\nBut thinking about this raises broader problems. If you think of elements in very broad terms you might want to get rid of all genre-specific elements. Drama is a relatively privileged genre in TEI \\(the division of prose, verse, and drama may be an odd reflection of the trinity of epic, drama, and lyric, with its own very genre specific tags. We run into the same inconsistencies. There are no elements for act or scene, but there are elements for prologue and epilogue, and for \"speech\", although one could made a good case that \"said\" would do just fine.\n\nIt's tough, and I could see going either way, although I'd probably rather go on a \"less is more\" path, which might mean abandoning rather than expanding postscript and other elements that sit at a similar level of genre specificity,\n\nOn the other hand, convenience is convenience. If we have &lt;lb&gt; for &lt;milestone unit=\"line\"\\)\n, why not admit the typographical elements of TEI Tite, which let you write y&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; rather than y&lt;hi rend=\"superscript&gt;e&lt;/hi&gt;.\n\nA lot of ambiguity here that cannot be solved and has to be lived with.

Recent discussion on TEI-L \\( http://listserv.brown.edu/archives/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind1103&L=TEI-L&T=0&F=&S=&P=17925 \\) seems to reach consensus that &lt;sense&gt; should be used even if there is only one sense in order to maintain parallel structure across entries and make processing of entries easier.

  "description": "This concerns only the LaTeX stylesheets.\r\n\r\nFrom what I understand support for math goes beyond what the stylesheets are designed to provide. This is understandable. However, as currently designed, the stylesheets create one obstacle to simple support for mathematics encoded according to TeX notation. I have a stylesheet which imports the latex2.xsl stylesheet but also has the necessary overrides so that this should work:\r\n\r\n&lt;formula notation=\"TeX\"&gt;x\\_1&lt;/formula&gt;\r\n\r\nIt should produce a \"x\" symbol with a subscripted 1. However, because the catcode for underscore is redefined by the stylesheet bundled with the TEI files, it generates \"x\" followed by an underscore followed by 1. In other words, the way the stylesheet currently works, underscore means underscore everywhere. Searching for solutions I came across the following code fragment:\r\n\r\n\\begingroup\r\n\\catcode\\`\\\\\\_=\\active\r\n\\gdef\\_\\#1\\{\\ensuremath\\{\\sb\\{\\mathrm\\{\\#1\\}\\}\\}\\}\r\n\\endgroup\r\n\\mathcode\\`\\\\\\_=\\string\"8000\r\n\\catcode\\`\\\\\\_=12\r\n\r\nI must admit this is beyond what I normally have to fiddle with when I use LaTeX but from what I understand, this ensures that underscore is treated as underscore outside of math but when in math it performs its traditional subscript function.\r\n\r\nI have used the above code fragment without problem so far.",

Part of the reason for the misunderstanding is that the current description of @mimeTime is veeeery general and we wanted to make some sense of it. The description should be more informative.\r\n\r\nAs for \"media types\", it seems to me that the term is at least three ways ambiguous, and the doc at http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4288.txt shows at least two, maybe all three of the usages. Besides interpreting the term as referring to the top-level type, e.g. \"text\", which we are rather not interested in here on its own, the treatment intended currently in the Guidelines apparently concerns the type/subtype combination, as in \"text/plain\", but as some RFCs stress or strongly recommend \\(e.g. http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3023.txt -- \"XML Media Types\"\\), it often makes sense to also use parameters, and these parameters are separated by a space, hence data.word alone indeed does not appear sufficient. Example from RFC3023: \"text/xml; charset='utf-8'\".\r\n\\------------------------------------------------------\r\nThe issue of the \"accept\" HTTP header that may need to go into a separate ticket for a separate attribute, leaving this one as solely informative, concerns strings such as:\r\n\r\n\"text/plain; q=0.5, text/html, text/x-dvi; q=0.8, text/x-c\"\r\n\r\nwhich means \"text/html and text/x-c are the preferred media types, but if they do not exist, then send the text/x-dvi entity, and if that does not exist, send the text/plain entity.\"",

Thi sis then transformed into HTML to be imported into OpenCMS. \r\n\r\nHowever, for this I'm wondering if it might not just be easier to use a jQuery plugin as you suggest and have multiple boxes displaying the last X items for each feed.  If it can't find the feed for whatever reason that should fail fairly gracefully \\(just not be there\\). \r\n\r\nJust haven't had a chance to sit down and test what jQuery plugin to use... was yours using a particular plugin that you can recommend or was it custom jquery?\r\n\r\n-james\r\n",

Furthermore, since Sourceforge discontinued offering blogs, we now use a wordpress.com blog for the TEI-C newsfeed.\r\n\r\nSince http://www.tei-c.org/Activities/ is created from TEI source, I believe we would need to place any frames on the left-hand side of the page, much like we've done with the feeds at http://www.tei-c.org/ .  I can't figure out how this happens, so I'll ask David Sewell to explain.\r\n\r\nThe first URL in the original ticket doesn't work any more, but the second still does.  However, it seems to include only feed items for new tickets, not for ongoing activity.  To show this, the URLs that James suggested in a previous comment give a number of options for feeds, some of which would be useful for us.\r\n\r\nWhatever feeds we include, we'll also need a mechanism for embedding them to show the latest few feed items.  jQuery might be one such tool.  I'm inclined to use the same thing as at http://www.tei-c.org/ for ease of maintenance.",

A cron job runs periodically \\(every 15 minutes?\\) on tei-c.org, invoking a shell script which grabs the WordPress Atom feed, compares the results to the existing feed, and if there's a difference, updates two HTML files on tei-c.org containing \\(1\\) the news headlines and \\(2\\) the full news body.\r\n\r\n2\\. File \\(1\\) is included on http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml through some arcane tinkering of the OpenCMS template files.  File \\(2\\) is included on http://www.tei-c.org/News/index.xml using a &lt;divGen&gt; inclusion.\r\n\r\nHe continued:\r\n\r\n\\#\\#\\#\r\n\r\nthis would all be non-trivial, probably, and might be something to defer to implementation in the next iteration of the TEI website. Adding a left-hand sidebar to the Activities page might not work as the interior sidebars are auto-generated by OpenCMS. Bottom-of-page iframes might work \\(if the XSLT will pass them through\\), but would we put raw RSS or transform it first?\r\n\r\nFrom a website-usability point of view, there's an argument against cluttering up the main Activities page with a massive amount of information that would overwhelm the casual visitor; what about prominent links to SF URLs that would display recent activity most effectively?\r\n\r\n\\#\\#\\#\r\n\r\nFor now I'm going to add a link from http://www.tei-c.org/Activities/ to https://sourceforge.net/export/rss2\\_project.php?group\\_id=106328 saying that users can follow TEI development using any of these feeds.",

  "description": "There has been some discussion of the relationship between tei:del and tei:gap in recent years, and although I think Council is in agreement that, for example, an erasure that cannot be read should be tagged as &lt;del&gt;&lt;gap/&gt;&lt;/del&gt; \\(rather than \\*&lt;gap reason=\"deleted\"/&gt; \\[1\\]\\), even some members of Council and/or those involved in an in-depth discussion of this topic in Galway in 2008 have not been able to reconstruct this decision clearly.\r\n\r\n\\[1\\] tei:gap and tei:del are different kinds of intervention in the text: the former is purely descriptive, \"I cannot, or have chosen not to, transcribe the text here\"; the latter is interpretive, \"an original or historical scribe deliberately chose to erase or obscure this text\". One might choose to say one or the other or both about a given span of text.\r\n\r\nI suggest:\r\n\r\n\\(a\\) adding an example with del containing a gap, showing this usage explicitly \\(and perhaps another example under subst, showing a substitution where the original text can no longer be read\\);\r\n\r\n\\(b\\) simplifying the prose in the note \\(currently: \"The text deleted must be at least partially legible, in order for the encoder to be able to transcribe it. Illegible text within a deletion may be marked using the gap tag to signal that text is present but has not been transcribed. Attributes on the gap element may be used to indicate how much text is omitted, the reason for omitting it, etc.\"\\) to make it explicit that del and gap perform different levels of function;\r\n\r\n\\(c\\) adding to the final note, \\(currently: \"The del tag should not be used for deletions made by editors or encoders. In these cases, either the corr tag or the gap tag should be used.\"\\) the element tei:surplus, which is also a form of editorial deletion...\r\n\r\n\\(I'm happy to make these changes if nobody objects.\\)",

        "text": "July 2006: Birgit Kellner posted to TEI-L ponting out that \r\n&lt;lacunaStart> and  &lt;lacunaEnd> can only appear in the context of  &lt;rdg> or &lt;lem> inside &lt;app>.\r\n\r\nThis assumes that the lacuna is within a section of a witness which constitutes a variant reading and is encoded within an  &lt;app>. \r\n\r\nHowever, It may be useful to mark a lacuna in the main body of the text, whether there is a variant or not, especially since it may be impossible to tell whether there is a variant at all, as the text is missing. This applies to either endpoint of a lacuna as well as the lacuna as a whole. (pun inadvertent). \r\n\r\nMissing text can be indicated by a &lt;gap> but this causes problems if the lacuna is large, or goes across lines or other structural elements.  Birgit also points out that it is problematic  \"semantically, since &lt;gap>  seems to refer to a gap in the text, but not to a gap in one or more witnesses used in its critical constitution\"\r\n\r\nhttp://listserv.brown.edu/archives/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0607&L=TEI-L&F=&S=&P=637\r\n\r\nThis got no response, and was re-animated in March 2011 by  Gottfried Koenen and Hayim Lapin. They are interested in automated collation, and want to mark &lt;witStart>, &lt;witEnd>, &lt;lacunaStart> and &lt;lacunaEnd> in texts without having to use &lt;rdg> or &lt;lem> They are both dealing with fragmentary texts.\r\n\r\nIt's possible to say that any intervention indicating the beginning or end of a lacuna or the beginning or end of a very fragmentary witness is by definition part of an apparatus, and therefore should be enclosed in  &lt;app> and &lt;rdg >. This only makes sense if variants from different witnesses are being encoded within a single file. Hayim's project is encoding each witness separately and is probably not using the apparatus elements. \r\n\r\nOne solution is to do what is requested, and allow the four elements &lt;witStart>, &lt;witEnd>, &lt;lacunaStart> and &lt;lacunaEnd> to appear in most places that <lb> or <pb> appear  by making them members of model.milestoneLike and moving them from the textcrit module to something more general. They function very much like milestone elements although the implicit structure they represent is somewhat less regular than pages, gatherings, columns or lines. On the other hand model.milestoneLike also includes &lt;anchor>. \r\n\r\nAnother solution is to instead suggest a different way of encoding, and suggest that &lt;anchor> or some other element be repurposed in order to indicate the same information, perhaps by giving it an @type. \r\n\r\nThe former solution is more semantically pleasing, but the latter is equally functional. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

So the proposal is to extend the model of table to include &lt;graphic&gt; . The prose should be revised not only for table but also for &lt;formula&gt; to explain that this is allowed. LB pointed out that you could use @facs, but MH replied that you should be able to choose between doing things in the same way as is done with &lt;formula&gt; if you wish, or use @facs throughout if that is your encoding practice. MH also pointed out that there is a use-case for more than one graphic \\(tables printed over several pages\\), so it should be one or more graphics. Set to pending, accepted and green.

As the position of such a description in the sequence of sorted descriptions is \"stable\" and also an important characteristic of the data, it seems reasonable to have the possibility to store the sorting key in an attribute. As those objects may have multiple identifiers, each of them possibly used for display and thus object for the sorting, it might be necessary not \\(only\\) to add the description as a whole \\(msDesc\\) but also the identifier of the object described itself \\(idno\\) to the class att.sortable.",

  "description": "Hi, I was looking at http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-relation.html today, and realized that it comes very close to being able to represent RDF-style triples.  Actually, I think it could do so now, but there are a couple of things I'd suggest TEI do:\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n&lt;placeName ref=\"http://sws.geonames.org/361059\"&gt;Alexandria&lt;/placeName&gt;\r\n&lt;placeName ref=\"http://sws.geonames.org/357994\"&gt;Egypt&lt;/placeName&gt;\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n&lt;relation xmlns:gn=\"http://www.geonames.org/ontology\\#\" ref=\"gn:parentFeature\" active=\"http://sws.geonames.org/361059\" passive=\"http://sws.geonames.org/357994\"/&gt;\r\n\r\ncould be a way to encode the triple Alexandria is a child feature of Egypt.  My first recommendation would be that the Guidelines say explicitly that using @ref on &lt;relation&gt; enables the encoding of RDF-style triples.\r\n\r\nMy second recommendation is that the attributes @active and @passive be deprecated and renamed.  The names are \\*extremely\\* confusing, unintuitive, and fail to describe the attributes' actual function.  Better would be @subject and @object \\(as in \"subject, predicate, object\"\\), which is a standard way of describing RDF triples.  The relations are directed graphs, so names drawn from graph theory terminology, like @head and @tail would be acceptable also.  Likewise @symmetric might be a better name than @mutual, but the latter is less bad than @active and @passive.  \r\n\r\nIt could be argued that @mutual is redundant, but I see the attraction of a single attribute that can express symmetric relationships.\r\n\r\nMy last recommendation is that the guidelines make it clear that &lt;relation&gt; is not just for persons, but can be used for relationships between places, objects, organizations, etc.  I wonder too whether elements like &lt;affiliation&gt; ought not to be considered refinements of &lt;relation&gt;.\r\n",

If no one objects I propose we accept this now.\r\n\r\n\\(2\\) Renaming the attributes @active and @passive: I agree in principle, but we really ought to canvess the community \\(via TEI-L\\) and see whether anyone is actually using these attributes. If so, we may want to slow down to avoid unnecessarily breaking backward-compatibility.\r\n\r\n\\(2a\\) Deprecating @mutual: assuming nobody is using this attribute, I'd be in favour of this. But again we need to see who that would hurt.\r\n\r\n\\(3\\) Extending &lt;relation&gt; for use outside of persons. This question is more tricky, and I think I'd resist just making this a universal linking element from the get-go, at least without much further discussion and research. However, since this element is currently defined for use within a tei:listPerson, I don't think it's a stretch to say we have a pretty good use-case for extending its use to listPlace and listOrg as well. \\(And maybe listNym?\\) There's nothing to stop us further extending its use as concrete use-cases arise.",

Triples are cleaner, and what I'm saying is that it will take at least Schematron to make sure we're looking at real triples \\*when\\* @ref is used. But then some will say \"why resign from encoding multiple triples in a single element\" and we're back at the beginning, with triples being \"asserted\" only in the text of the Guidelines. In yet other words: maybe, just maybe, if this element is to evolve in the direction of the RDF, at least the \\(renamed?\\) @active and @passive should allow for single references only.\r\n\r\n3\\) concerning @active and @passive: who is active in \"John loves Picasso\", or \"John loves doing nothing\"? A nitpick, of course, but @subject and @object seem indeed better, less assumption-laden -- they don't mix the surfacey issue of the position of an argument in the argument list with the nature of the relationship \\(experiencing emotions is not really an active role\\).\r\n\r\n4\\) how about \\(i\\) deprecating @active and @passive, and \r\n\r\n\\(ii\\) using @subject and @object as single-reference attributes, and assert their presence when @ref is used \\(RDF-like behaviour\\), and \r\n\r\n\\(iii\\) using @subjectList and @objectList \\(to allow for the current, lumping behaviour of @active and @passive\\), and asserting the respective mutual incompatibility @subjectList and @objectList with @subject and @object?",

Can anyone name an immutable characteristic of a person? I think it would be better to just have states and events. \\(Each event would then correspond to a state-transition.\\) Also, I think that the structure of TEI needs to be revised so that prosopography records are more logically structured. I would like to see person records which allow lists of states, relations, events, and places to be included in a simple way. At the moment one needs to do structural gymnastics. ",

In the Sharing Ancient Wisdoms project \\[1\\] we are marking up manuscripts containing Greek and Arabic collections of wise sayings. We want to use RDF or similar to represent the relationships between and within these collections of sayings.\n\nOne thing that is very important for us is to include something like a @resp attribute to mark who is identifying a particular relation. This is because many of our relations are subjective, with different people having different views on how the texts link together.\n\nTo achieve this, we have discussed a slightly different format to encode RDF within a TEI document: using the reading element &lt;rdg&gt; with a @rel attribute, within the markup of the subject/active/head itself. E.g.:\n\nDocument 1:\n... \n&lt;seg xml:id=\"http://www.ancientwisdoms.ac.uk/Th\\_s3\"&gt; \\[arabic text\\] &lt;/seg&gt;\n...\n\nDocument 2: \n... \nxmlns:saws=\"http://www.ancientwisdoms.ac.uk/ontology\\#\"\n...\n&lt;seg xml:id=\"http://www.ancientwisdoms.ac.uk/Th\\_tr\\_s3\"&gt;\n&lt;rdg rel=\"saws:isCloseTranslationOf\" resource=\"http://www.ancientwisdoms.ac.uk/Th\\_n3\" resp=\"elvira\"/&gt;\nWhoever performs an action in secret, yet is embarrassed by it in public, is a worthless person.\n&lt;/seg&gt;\n...\n\n\n\\(One advantage of this is that multiple readings are possible using this format.\\)\n\nSo my questions are:\n\n1\\. The suggestion by Hugh Cayless seem to have been more or less agreed? Is there a timescale for when this will be adopted as standard in TEI? \n\n2\\. Is there a way of incorporating @resp within &lt;relation&gt; ? \\(or something similar to @resp\\)\n\n3\\. Using the format suggested by Hugh Cayless, should our relation example be expressed \\(with resp...\\) as:\n&lt;relation ref=\"saws:isCloseTranslationOf\" active=\"http://www.ancientwisdoms.ac.uk/Th\\_tr\\_s3\" passive=\"http://www.ancientwisdoms.ac.uk/Th\\_n3\" resp=elvira/&gt; \n\n?\n\nAny comments/feedback welcomed.\n\n\\[1\\] http://www.kcl.ac.uk/innovation/groups/cerch/research/projects/current/saws.aspx",

One of the proposals made in that discussion, not reflected in the other two tickets, was that the content model of subst should be simplified.\r\n\r\nThe model currently allows:\r\n\r\nadd corr del orig reg sic unclear\r\napp\r\ndamage restore supplied surplus\r\n\r\nBut we could not come up with any compelling use-case for any of these elements other than add and del.\r\n\r\nThere was a concern about the implications for backward-compatibility if the content model of subst were to be so radically restricted now. On the other hand, it was felt that the inclusion of these elements could be considered an error in the first place, which would reduce the negative impact of such an action, but we decided that the community should be surveyed with regards to current usage of subst and its children. Possible outcomes depending on the result of said survey \\(and discussion in council\\) might include:\r\n\r\n\\(1\\) making a strong recommendation in the relevant TEI Guidelines chapters only to use add and del rather than all the available children, but not otherwise resstricting the schema \\(until, perhaps, a complete overhaul of the scale of P6\\);\r\n\r\n\\(2\\) gradually deprecate the use of all elements other than add and del within subst, so that they are disrecommended now and removed from the schema in, say, 6 or 12 months time;\r\n\r\n\\(3\\) move towards entirely removing these elements from subst at the next formal release.\r\n\r\n\\(In other words, more discussion is needed on whether to deprecate the use of these elements within subst slowly or quickly.\\)",

  "description": "Currently if one writes an ODD customization file that sucks in two or more external schemas via moduleRef/@url, there is a risk of name collision in the names of patterns. In fact, if the two external schemas that are sucked in are RELAX NG itself and ISO Schematron, there is pattern name collision. To avoid this problem I have updated teiodd.xsl so that it generates a prefix for each external schema, and prepends that value to each pattern name from that schema in the generated RELAX NG.\r\n\r\nThis change was checked in at revision 9244.\r\n\r\nThe prefixes that are currently generated are created by using generate-id\\(\\). Thus they are guaranteed to be different for different schemas, guaranteed to be NCNames, and essentially guaranteed to be non-mnemonic, ugly, and hard to read. But most importantly, because they are generated at run-time, you can't reference them from within the ODD. Thus you solve the problem of getting an invalid RNG schema, but the external schema isn't of much use.\r\n\r\nI think it would make sense to add @prefix to &lt;moduleRef&gt; for this purpose. This would allow for mnemonic, easy to read prefixes that would allow the external schema patterns to be referenced from within the ODD. The @prefix attribute should be allowed iff the @url attribute is present, I should think.\r\n\r\nIf this were to be done, there would then be three elements \\(&lt;moduleRef&gt;, &lt;schemaSpec&gt;, and &lt;elementSpec&gt;\\) that carry @prefix, so it should probably be moved into a class of its own. Perhaps att.differentiatable, or att.disambiguatable.\r\n\r\nP.S. The code already checked in at 9244 actually tests for @prefix, and uses generate-id\\(\\) if it's not there. So if & when this change is made, no change is needed to the code.",

It also seems to me that the ability to mark uncertainty and imprecision for any aspect of any element is already provided for by existing standoff mechanisms. I'd be reluctant to make this change without better examination of some specific real cases.

        "text": "This was discussed in some detail at the last Council F2F, and I thought Lou had withdrawn his objections on that occasion, but I'll try to reconstruct some of the arguments here, for the record.\r\n\r\n\\(1\\) The issue with empty elements being expected to be empty is a fair point, but I think it applies more to the presence of text-containing elements such as &lt;desc&gt; or &lt;gloss&gt;, which I agree we don't need in milestoneLike and other empty elements. But having an empty element such as certainty/precision/respons inside &lt;lb&gt; is not especially confusing, and I can't see any way that this would break processes that don't expect them--at worst they'd be ignored. An element like this inside another element is just a form of enhanced attribute, really. \\(And if you don't like it, then you don't have to use it, or you can cleanly remove the possibility in your ODD.\\)\r\n\r\n\\(2\\) There are several different kinds of uncertainty that might be expressed about \\(e.g.\\) an &lt;lb&gt; other than merely that it might or might not be in the right place for a given edition. The lb element bears several attributes, including @n, @corresp, @break, @ed, and I've had cause to hedge all of these on occasion, and more importantly to offer alternative possible values using the @assertedValue attribute of &lt;certainty/&gt;. Contrary to Lou's assertion, I don't know how I would interpret @cert on &lt;lb/&gt;; it could mean too many different things. To take another example, a certainty declaration pointing to a &lt;handShift&gt; element could refer to the location of the hand-shift, its very existence, the identity of the new hand starting here, the scribe/script/medium, etc. \\(And again, alternative values may be offered.\\)\r\n\r\n\\(3\\) It is true of course that there is already a way to do this using a stand-off &lt;certainty/&gt; pointing to an @xml:id on the target element. But the @match atribute on certainty/precision etc. was deployed a few releases ago because it was felt \\(and I still maintain it is the case\\) that it is easier both for a human and in certain editing environments to write and interpret\r\n&lt;gap&gt;&lt;certainty match=\"..\"/&gt;&lt;/gap&gt;\r\nthan\r\n&lt;gap xml:id=\"g0097356\"/&gt; &lt;\\!--arbitrary distance later--&gt; &lt;certainty target=\"\\#g0097356\"/&gt;\r\nFar from creating chaos by introducing a new way to mark uncertainty, the change proposed in this ticket is actually creating further consistency by allowing this already-existing method for pointing to a target element to be used more universally. \\(I would like, for example, to use certainty/@match for all occurances of certainty across a given project, rather than @match in some cases and standoff @target in others where the schema does not allow it.\\)\r\n\r\nThe proposal sent to the Council mailing list, and expanded by Kevin, is to add these three elements to the content model of the milestoneLike elements \\(cb, gb, lb, milestone, pb\\), transcriptional elements \\(caesura, handShift, pause, redo, shift, undo, move\\), spanning elements \\(addSpan, anchor, damageSpan, delSpan, lacunaEnd, lacunaStart, witEnd, witStart\\) and dictionary elements \\(oRef, pRef\\). While the real-world use-cases so far adduced are restricted to milestoneLike elements, the survey of all empty elements was requested presumably because it is always better to introduce a change to the TEI in a consistent and coherent way than to introduce a one-off patch to a single element per use-case.",

        "text": "Apologies for being still unconvinced, but for the record here are my responses on these 3 points:\r\n\r\n1\\. I agree that the situation  is slightly less confusing iif the intention is to permit only some specific elements \\(all of which are  empty\\) within some other specific empty elements. In which case we should define a new class \\( \"model.metaMark\" anyone?\\) and revise the content models for the proposed elements from \\(EMPTY\\) to \\(model.metaMark\\*\\)\r\n\r\n2\\. @cert is about the certainty of the assertion expressed by the element to which it's attached -- not any particular attribute of it. Hence my suggestion that when it appears on an &lt;lb/&gt; it can only relate to the whole of the information conveyed by that element, and the possibility of repeating that element if different aspects have different degrees of certainty, as in my Marks and Spencer example below.\r\n\r\n3\\. Gabby says\r\n\"it is easier both for a human and in certain editing environments to write and\r\ninterpret &lt;gap&gt;&lt;certainty match=\"..\"/&gt;&lt;/gap&gt;\r\nthan &lt;gap xml:id=\"g0097356\"/&gt; &lt;\\!--arbitrary distance later--&gt; &lt;certainty\r\ntarget=\"\\#g0097356\"/&gt;\"\r\n\r\nBut if the distance is arbitrary it might be zero. In which case, I cannot see much distinction between\r\n&lt;gap&gt;&lt;certainty match=\"..\"/&gt;&lt;/gap&gt;\r\nand\r\n&lt;gap xml:id=\"g0097356\"/&gt;  &lt;certainty target=\"\\#g0097356\"/&gt;\r\nother than the need for an identifier and the link to it. I can't imagine anyone doing this kind of markup manually so is that really such an overhead?\r\n\r\nIn any case, the major point of controversy here seems to be whether  the existing standoff solution is  really annoying enough to warrant  the fairly major upheaval being proposed by this ticket. \r\n",

If they do wish to differentiate between those things that are usually time-dependent or not, or 'intrinsic' / 'essential' then they can use both &lt;state&gt; and &lt;trait&gt;. Remarks on trait/state specs should indicate this.\r\n\r\n2\\) All examples in the Guidelines of trait having date-related attributes should be rationalized. I.e. they should be changed to &lt;state&gt; where appropriate, or they should have the attributes removed. While dating attributes are allowed on &lt;trait&gt; by the schema we should indicate good practice in the examples by only having them on &lt;state&gt;. Remarks should be added to trait to indicate this.\r\n\r\n3\\) the elements that claim membership of traitLike and stateLike classes be merged into only claiming membership stateLike and any content-models referring to traitLike alone updated to refer to stateLike alone because it is believed these two content models are used identically throughout. \\(However, this will be checked\\).\r\n\r\nAnything I'm missing?",

  "summary": "Introduce standard attributes to refer to ISOCat",
  "description": "ISO 12620:2009 is a standard describing the data model and procedures for a Data Category Registry \\(DCR\\). Data categories are defined as elementary descriptors in a linguistic structure. In the DCR data model each data category gets assigned a unique Peristent IDentifier \\(ID\\), i.e., an URI. Linguistic resources or preferably their schemas that make use of data categories from a DCR should refer to them using this PID. For XML-based resources, like TEI documents, ISO 12620:2009 normative Annex A gives a small Data Category Reference XML vocabulary \\(also available online at http://www.isocat.org/12620/\\) which provides two attributes dcr:datcat anddcr:valueDatcat. The following TEI example illustrates its usage in a TEI feature \\(structure\\):\r\n\r\n&lt;tei:TEI xmlns:tei=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\" xmlns:dcr=\"http://www.isocat.org/ns/dcr\"&gt;\r\n...\r\n&lt;tei:fs&gt;\r\n...\r\n&lt;tei:f \r\nname=\"part of speech\"\r\ndcr:datcat=\"http://www.isocat.org/datcat/DC-1345\"\r\nfVal=\"common noun\"\r\ndcr:valueDatcat=\"http://www.isocat.org/datcat/DC-1256\"\r\n/&gt; \r\n...\r\n&lt;/tei:fs&gt;\r\n...\r\n&lt;/tei:TEI&gt;\r\n\r\nIn this example @dcr:datcat relates the feature name to a /partOfSpeech/ data category and @dcr:valueDatcat the feature value to a /commonNoun/ data category. Both these data categories reside in the ISOcat DCR atwww.isocat.org, which is the DCR is use by ISO TC37 and hosted by its registration authority the MPI for Psycholinguistics. The given example results currently in an invalid TEI document, and the proposal is to remedy that by adding the dcr:datcat and dcr:valueDatcat attributes to the TEI global attribute list. This would allow referring to the used data categories from any place in a TEI document.\r\n",

However, the bar for registration is fairly high: among other things, \"New URI schemes SHOULD have clear utility to the broad Internet community\" and \"a URI scheme definition SHOULD define the applicable set of operations that may be performed on a resource using the URI as its identifier\".  It seems to me that most uses of @key would not satisfy these.  While there are many unregistered \\(de facto\\) URI schemes in use today, but I don't think it's a good idea for the Guidelines to prescribe such practice since the point of registering schemes is to avoid collisions.\r\n\r\nAs for URNs, I realize now that they aren't a good choice since RFC 2141 never advanced beyond being a proposed standard.\r\n\r\nHowever, the solution Syd proposed on http://purl.org/TEI/fr/2919640 -- for use of the IANA-registered \"tag\" URI scheme \\(as described in RFC 4151\\) -- appears to be exactly what we need as a replacement for a deprecated @key.  This scheme explicitly does not require any registration of the name of the taggingEntity beyond what is already done through DNS registration \\(or having an email address\\).\r\n\r\nSo I will change all uses of @key in examples in the Guidelines to use this format:\r\n\r\nref=\"tag:example.org,2012:foo\"\r\n\r\nexcept for those like &lt;country key=\"FR\"/&gt; which already refer to a particular external vocabulary.  I will also refer explicitly to RFC 4151 where appropriate for further guidance on constructing a value of @ref.\r\n\r\nNote that use of tag URIs does not prohibit any user of the TEI from using a registered or unregistered scheme on a URN or URI if they prefer.",

The implicit recommendation is to use the W3C's Internationalization Tag Set:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.w3.org/TR/its/\r\n\r\nwhich would involve using e.g. @its:dir=\"rtl\" for right-to-left. There is an example showing how to build a TEI schema in the Exemplars:\r\n\r\nhttp://tei.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/tei/trunk/P5/Exemplars/\r\n\r\nITS, however, doesn't handle vertical text layout \\(as in Japanese, for instance\\). \r\n\r\nThe proposal is to add a new section to Languages and Character Sets \\(CH\\) that covers:\r\n\r\n\\- Inherent directionality in Unicode codepoints\r\n\\- Unicode embedding and override codepoints for directionality\r\n\\- Desirability of making directionality explicit in encoding \\(ref http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-bidi-css-markup\\)\r\n\\- Recommended use of ITS, and explanation of how to create a schema incorporating it\r\n\\- Possible approaches to vertical orientation using CSS \\(http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-writing-modes/\\)\r\n\\- Differentiation between vertical orientation as common in Japanese text and rotated blocks, which can be handled with tei:zone/@rotate.",

But there may be historical catalogs or special-use catalogs where items lack titles, so I am willing to allow the use of case of someone wanting to use &lt;biblStruct&gt; for citations to items without titles.\r\n\r\nRegarding \\(b\\), I do not believe we should be flexible on this point.  &lt;biblStruct&gt; is structured in the order that elements are allowed, so if you have an &lt;idno&gt;, it has to go at a particular point in the XML tree.  If you want to arrange the components of a citation in a different order, you need to use &lt;bibl&gt;.  The good news, though, is that if we change the content model of &lt;monogr&gt; so that &lt;title&gt; is no longer mandatory, I think this solves Javier's problem anyway.",

An example: a &lt;biblScope type=\"issue\"&gt; in the journal part of a bibliographic reference to an article contains the issue number of the volume in which the article appears. It's the whole thing, in other words. But a &lt;biblScope type=\"pp\"&gt; in the same bibliographic reference would, under this proposal, not refer to the page range of the whole article, but the page\\(s\\) of the subset of the article which the reference is citing.

        "text": "Let me first address Gabby's comment in parentheses.  I believe he is saying that we can keep this all much simpler by changing nothing in the TEI except introducing a new element &lt;biblCitedRange&gt; for the cited subset of a work, which would occur anywhere that &lt;biblScope&gt; is currently allowed.  We would then change many though not all examples in the Guidelines that currently use &lt;biblScope&gt; to use &lt;biblCitedRange&gt;.  What would be left in &lt;biblScope&gt; would be those cases where you're giving the whole range of pages for an item -- basically, those that in the proposal would be moved to &lt;extent&gt;.   At that point it would be even less clear to me now what the semantic difference is between &lt;biblScope&gt; and &lt;extent&gt;.  So while it seems less disruptive, I don't know that we've solved much.\r\n\r\nIn examining Gabby's comment outside the parentheses, I see that while this proposal brings a certain symmetry to the TEI, it also makes some choices between options without justification.\r\n\r\nUnder the proposal, Gabby's first example would be:\r\n\r\n\\(1\\)     &lt;biblStruct&gt;\r\n&lt;monogr&gt;\r\n&lt;author&gt;P. Romanelli&lt;/author&gt;\r\n&lt;title&gt;Leptis Magna&lt;/title&gt;\r\n&lt;imprint&gt;\r\n&lt;pubPlace&gt;Roma&lt;/pubPlace&gt;\r\n&lt;date&gt;1925&lt;/date&gt;\r\n&lt;/imprint&gt;\r\n&lt;/monogr&gt;\r\n&lt;series&gt;\r\n&lt;title&gt;Africae Italiana: Monografie a cura del Ministero delle Colonie&lt;/title&gt;\r\n&lt;biblScope type=\"vol\"&gt;1&lt;/biblScope&gt;\r\n&lt;/series&gt;\r\n&lt;/biblStruct&gt;\r\n\r\nI think he and I agree that we like this.  But his second example would be:\r\n\r\n\\(2a\\)    &lt;biblStruct&gt;\r\n&lt;analytic&gt;\r\n&lt;author&gt;R. Bartoccini&lt;/author&gt;\r\n&lt;title&gt;Roman Roads&lt;/title&gt;\r\n&lt;extent type=\"pp\" from=\"150\" to=\"157\"&gt;150-7&lt;/extent&gt;\r\n&lt;/analytic&gt;\r\n&lt;monogr&gt;\r\n&lt;title&gt;Epigraphica&lt;/title&gt;\r\n&lt;biblScope type=\"vol\"&gt;X&lt;/biblScope&gt;\r\n&lt;imprint&gt;\r\n&lt;date&gt;1948&lt;/date&gt;\r\n&lt;/imprint&gt;\r\n&lt;/monogr&gt;\r\n&lt;/biblStruct&gt;\r\n\r\nand yet, by the principle followed \\(though never explicitly explained\\) in the proposal of using &lt;extent&gt; for the whole and &lt;biblScope&gt; for the parts \\(the way to achieve goal 1 in the proposal\\), this second citation could just as easily be:\r\n\r\n\\(2b\\)    &lt;biblStruct&gt;\r\n&lt;analytic&gt;\r\n&lt;author&gt;R. Bartoccini&lt;/author&gt;\r\n&lt;title&gt;Roman Roads&lt;/title&gt;\r\n&lt;/analytic&gt;\r\n&lt;monogr&gt;\r\n&lt;title&gt;Epigraphica&lt;/title&gt;\r\n&lt;biblScope type=\"vol\"&gt;X&lt;/biblScope&gt;\r\n&lt;biblScope type=\"pp\" from=\"150\" to=\"157\"&gt;150-7&lt;/biblScope&gt;\r\n&lt;imprint&gt;\r\n&lt;date&gt;1948&lt;/date&gt;\r\n&lt;/imprint&gt;\r\n&lt;/monogr&gt;\r\n&lt;/biblStruct&gt;\r\n\r\nThat is, there's no justification for why the range of pages for an entire article in a journal or an entire chapter in a book should be in analytic/extent\\[@type='pp'\\] and not in monogr/biblScope\\[@type='pp'\\].  Similarly, If you wanted to give the range of pages for an entire volume in a series that has continual numbering throughout, there's no justification for why you should use monogr/extent\\[@type='pp'\\] and not series/biblScope\\[@type='pp'\\].  Putting it another way, we haven't achieved goal 2 of the proposal.  And I'm not sure what to propose to fix this.\r\n\r\nLooking at \\(2a\\) and \\(2b\\), I realize that even these are misleading since \\*Epigraphic\\* was published for many years, not just in 1948.  If we fixed this in \\(2b\\), it would in theory be:\r\n\r\n\\(3\\)     &lt;biblStruct&gt;\r\n&lt;analytic&gt;\r\n&lt;author&gt;R. Bartoccini&lt;/author&gt;\r\n&lt;title&gt;Roman Roads&lt;/title&gt;\r\n&lt;/analytic&gt;\r\n&lt;monogr&gt;\r\n&lt;title&gt;Epigraphica&lt;/title&gt;\r\n&lt;biblScope type=\"vol\"&gt;X&lt;/biblScope&gt;\r\n&lt;biblScope type=\"pp\" from=\"150\" to=\"157\"&gt;150-7&lt;/biblScope&gt;\r\n&lt;biblScope type=\"date\"&gt;1948&lt;/biblScope&gt;\r\n&lt;/monogr&gt;\r\n&lt;/biblStruct&gt;\r\n\r\nbut then we would need to change the content model of &lt;monogr&gt; to no longer require an &lt;imprint&gt;.\r\n\r\nIn fact, now that I think about it, I wonder whether the TEI should in fact use &lt;series&gt;, not &lt;monogr&gt;, for information about a journal, which would require changing the content model of &lt;biblStruct&gt; and the definition of &lt;monogr&gt; \\(instead of changing the content model of &lt;monogr&gt; to require an &lt;imprint&gt;\\).  That, is, it would instead be encoded as:\r\n\r\n\\(4\\)     &lt;biblStruct&gt;\r\n&lt;analytic&gt;\r\n&lt;author&gt;R. Bartoccini&lt;/author&gt;\r\n&lt;title&gt;Roman Roads&lt;/title&gt;\r\n&lt;/analytic&gt;\r\n&lt;series&gt;\r\n&lt;title&gt;Epigraphica&lt;/title&gt;\r\n&lt;biblScope type=\"vol\"&gt;X&lt;/biblScope&gt;\r\n&lt;biblScope type=\"pp\" from=\"150\" to=\"157\"&gt;150-7&lt;/biblScope&gt;\r\n&lt;biblScope type=\"date\"&gt;1948&lt;/biblScope&gt;\r\n&lt;/series&gt;\r\n&lt;/biblStruct&gt;\r\n\r\nI'm not sure of the path forward.  :\\(",

        "text": "I'm obviously a lot less specialist in bibliographic markup than Kevin, but my understanding of the different between &lt;extent&gt; and &lt;biblScope&gt; is that the latter allows you to express a range \\(of pages, volumes etc.\\) that defines a part \\(a scope\\) of a larger whole: pp. 12-20 of a book, issue 115 of a journal, etc., whereas &lt;extent&gt; is for a expression of total size: this book contains xiv+355 pages; this monograph is made up of 3 volumes; this film is 100 minutes long. \\(So I agree that biblScope as in \\(2b\\) is more appropriate than extent as in \\(2a\\)--although I'm still twitchy on the location of it.\\)\r\n\r\nThe difficult distinction, therefore, is not between biblScope and extent, which as I see it are pretty unambiguous \\(extent is rarely if ever used in a footnote; biblScope perhaps not so often used in a library or bookseller catalogue\\), but between biblScope and biblCitedRange. This would involve explaining the difference between two kinds of page numbers \\(e.g.\\) which are currently, and fairly intuitively, tagged using biblScope.\r\n\r\nTwo questions: \\#1 can we comfortably and unambiguously define the difference between a range of pages \\(or single page\\) that define the scope of a complete bibliographic item being listed, and a range of pages of single page that define the subset of the listed bibliographic item being cited? \\#2 do we feel it's necessary to distinguish between these two things, given that we've never done so before? I wonder if the distinction may not inherent in where in your bibliographic hierarchy the biblScope lives, but I'd have to sit down and look at some examples with the help of an expert like Kevin or Laurent to come up with a coherent proposal on this front.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, I'm not convinced that we should ever use &lt;biblScope type=\"date\"&gt;--that seems barbaric to me. The date in the imprint of the journal example refers to the publication date of Epigraphica 10, so it is not a further subset of that issue. If the journal Epigraphica had changed publishers over the years, presumably the publisher and pubPlace within that imprint would also refer to those in place when issue 10 was published, and not imply that it referred to the entire run of the journal. The presence of &lt;biblscope type=\"pp\"&gt; in this same monogr is confusing, though: it's not the issue of the journal that is limited by these pages, but the article within it.",

A couple years ago I mentioned the problem of encoding the texts of the Tibetan canon, which have two species of \"raisins\" in the oatmeal text: inserted, complete verses from the older, root text \\(external text or floating text\\) and interwoven, quoted, partial phrases from the root text.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first species is like the nesting of boxes within one another. Each box has its own completeness. For example, there is an orderly sequence of verses of the root text, e.g., Fundamental Wisdom of the Middle Way by the 2nd century philosopher Nagarjuna, quoted in later, nested commentaries that follow the same sequence of verses. Each of Nagarjuna's verses is commented upon by the 7th century philosopher Chandrakirti for a page or two; then each of Chandrakirti's comments are nested within the longer text of the 16th century Tibetan philosopher Mikyo Dorje and commented upon by him. And so on.\r\n\r\nThe second species is more like melting chunks of butter in the oatmeal: certain words or phrases from Nagarjuna's verses--usually incomplete sentences--are mingled with Chandrakirti's own words to create complete sentences in Chandrakirti's commentary.  The same strategy is used by Mikyo Dorje, who mingles either Nagarjuna's words or Chandrakirti's words with his own to create complete sentences in his commentary.  \r\n\r\nIf you can, could you please add this complex structural device of Tibetan texts to your discussion of floating text?\"",

        "text": "After reading it again, and after today's brief discussion, I find the following aspects of Martin's proposal unconvincing:\r\n\r\nHe suggests that &lt;floatingText&gt; will not do because \"Why wrap paragraphs in two elements \\(floatingText/body\\) when one will do?\" I think the additional penalty of &lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt; is trivial.\r\n\r\nHe says that \"The formal definition of &lt;floatingText&gt; is purely syntactic.\" I'm not sure I really understand what that means, but the quote from Kevin that supports it includes this: \"The &lt;floatingText&gt; element is simply used whenever the richer content model it provides is required to support mark up of a text or part of a text which presented as a discrete inclusion within the text.\" This seems to me to be basically what he's looking for in &lt;floatingDiv&gt;.\r\n\r\nFinally, he says \"the names of the elements \\(text, body\\) and the double wrapper suggest that &lt;floatingText&gt; is a weighty matter, and quotes Paul's description of \"headed, floating, discrete textual objects that seem too small to qualify as &lt;text&gt;s and possessed of too much integrity to be mere line groups or paragraphs\". I don't really know why anything would be too small to qualify as a &lt;text&gt; -- inscriptions are texts, haikus are texts, and there are lots of other tiny examples of texts. \r\n\r\nSo I think we could expand and clarify the explanation of &lt;floatingText&gt; to show that we think it is appropriate for use in the case of smaller embedded \"raisins\", and provide some examples in support.",

  "description": "We are implementing a project for encoding our patent and non-patent literature according to the TEI standard.\r\n\r\nFor  doing so, we would need to have a very precise bibliographical reference \\(very important in the patent literature\\) of patent documents.\r\nThe current TEI standard does not allow us to encode the patent bibliographical citations. In the patents, the patent documents are cited according to a very well defined encoding for which the main elements are:\r\n\r\n\\- Identification of a Patent Authority\r\n\\- Identification of a Patent Number\r\n\\- Identification of a Date\r\n\\- Identification of a Kind Code\r\n\r\n\r\nTherefore, we would need to have the following structure in TEI for encoding the bibliographic information of patents:\r\n\r\n&lt;biblStruct type=\"patent\u00a6utilityModel\u00a6designPatent\u00a6plant\" status=\"application\u00a6publication\"&gt;\r\n&lt;monogr&gt;\r\n&lt;authority&gt;\r\n&lt;orgName type=\"national\u00a6regional\"&gt;&lt;orgName&gt;\r\n&lt;/authority&gt;\r\n&lt;idno type=\"docNumber\"&gt;&lt;/idno&gt;\r\n&lt;date type=\"\"applicationDate\u00a6publicationDate\"&gt;&lt;/date&gt;\r\n&lt;imprint&gt;\r\n&lt;idno type=\"kindCode\"&gt;&lt;/idno&gt;\r\n&lt;/imprint&gt;\r\n&lt;/monogr&gt; \r\n&lt;/biblStruct&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\nI would like to add some examples, to show the importance of having this structure for our project:\r\n\r\n1\\) Normally in the patent documents, the citation of other patents is one of the most important information.\r\nThis citation could identify the priority patents, related patents or simply are patents cited in the document.\r\nThe bibliographical reference to these patents is done without indicating any title, but using the patent standard bibliographical codification.\r\nSee the following examples \\(I attached a file with the corresponding images\\) \r\n\r\nE1\\) In this text \\(from a patent\\) another patent is cited by: \"Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 223883/1974 \r\nE2\\) in this example you can see how normally the bibliographical information of the patents is provided: \r\nE3\\) also non-patent literature uses very often this kind of citation, see the following example:\r\n\r\n2\\) I would like also to indicate that there are different citation manual styles which explicitly avoid to use the title and other information to cite the patents:\r\n\r\nBluebook Citation:\r\nU.S. Patent No. 6,885,550 \\(issued Apr. 26, 2005\\).\r\n\r\nAPA Citation:\r\nWilliams, D. \\(2005\\). U.S. Patent No. 6,885,550. Washington, DC: U.S.\r\n\r\nACS Citation:\r\nWilliams, D. U.S. Patent 6,885,550, 2005.\r\n",

Therefore, the kindCode provides the information relating to the publication or distribution of the patent \\(for example if it is a patent published after a search of the patent examiner, or patent published during the examination procedure...\\).\nA patent, during its life cycle, is published \"physically\" several times, each version corresponding to additional corrections and refinements. It appears thus appropriate to put the identifier corresponding to the publication under the element grouping information related to publication of the bibliographical item, so imprint. One can refer to a patent, or to a particular patent publication. \n\nRegarding your two questions I will now answer them, the arguments being basically already provided in the explanation above:\n\nRegarding \\(1\\), in our proposal, the idno corresponding to the patent number \\(&lt;idno type=\"docNumber\"&gt;...&lt;/idno&gt;\\) specifies the patent as a separate stand-alone bibliographical entity, which correspond to an independent item which can be cited as such. This sort of bibliographic information is normally grouped in the monogr section together with information like inventors, similarly as a book or a report. The patent number is actually relatively similar to a volume of a serial publication, the serie being the granting patent authority \\(e.g. patent publication 000001 from the USPTO\\). It does not appear to us consistent to put the a similarly semantic idno under biblStruct for patent, and under monogr for a book. \n\nRegarding \\(2\\), the TEI indicates that &lt;imprint&gt; groups information relating to the publication or distribution of a bibliographic item. As explained before, a patent is identify with a set of metadata, and a patent publication by the additional \"kind code\". A patent, during its life cycle, is published \"physically\" several times, each version corresponding to additional corrections and refinements. It appears thus appropriate to put the identifier corresponding to the publication under the element grouping information related to publication of the bibliographical item, so imprint.

        "text": "I see what you are saying about \\(1\\).  Now that I look over section 3.11.1 of the Guidelines, I am reminded that even in a simple &lt;biblStruct&gt;, usually all components of the citation are wrapped in &lt;monogr&gt;.  While a few elements are allowed outside of &lt;analytic&gt;, &lt;monogr&gt;, and &lt;series&gt;, these appear to be for exceptional purposes where the information outside of these elements refers to more than one of them.  So I now agree that it makes sense for a patent number to be inside &lt;monogr&gt;.  And since you have patent citations that lack titles, we should no longer require &lt;title&gt; inside &lt;monogr&gt; to support this usage.\r\n\r\nRegarding \\(2\\), thank you for the explanation of what a patent kindCode is.  You hadn't actually explained it before, and nothing about the term \"kind code\" indicated to me that it relates to the publication or distribution of the patent document.  \\(I would have guessed that a kind of patent is a classification along the lines of \"physical device\", \"business process\", etc.\\)  However, from your description, it sounds like such a code isn't really an \"identifier used to identify some object\" \\(from the definition of &lt;idno&gt;\\); rather, it's akin to how &lt;term&gt; is used within &lt;keywords&gt;, no?  That is, I actually think it might make more sense to use &lt;term&gt; for \\(2\\).  What do you think?\r\n\r\nSo at this point I am prepared to support the following four changes to P5 content models to support citations of patents:\r\n\r\na\\) Add @status to &lt;biblStruct&gt; by way of adding this element to the\r\natt.docStatus class.\r\n\r\nb\\) Allow &lt;authority&gt; as a child of &lt;monogr&gt;.\r\n\r\nc\\) No longer require &lt;title&gt; inside &lt;monogr&gt;.\r\n\r\nd\\) Allow &lt;term&gt; as a child of &lt;imprint&gt;.\r\n\r\nAs before, if other members of Council agree\r\nwith these changefs, I suggest we do two things:\r\n\r\n1\\.

Aside from Lou's objection to omission of a &lt;title&gt; in a TEI-encoded citation \\(which both Javier and Kevin feel there is a good use case for\\), the only outstanding question is whether to how to encode the \"kind code\".  This contains a coding used by a particular patent office to note the status of a document in the application and publication process.  The codes vary between patent offices.  At the European Patent Office, there are four or five codes that apply to patent applications and four or five which apply to patent publications.  \\(Javier will provide the kind codes used by the European Patent Office in a comment on this ticket to make this discussion more concrete.\\)  Patents are sometimes cited as an application or publication \\(the value of biblStruct@status\\) without reference to the kind code, so we can't simply put the kind code in biblStruct@status.\r\n\r\nJavier feels that the kind code relates to the publication of the patent and therefore belongs inside &lt;imprint&gt;.  Kevin suggested imprint@status, but Javier said that kind codes feel to him more like content than an attribute value.  If there is a use case where you might want to use markup within a kind code \\(for example, if you are transcribing patent citations that include kind codes from a source document and want to use &lt;sic&gt; or &lt;corr&gt;\\), then it definitely need to be in an element.\r\n\r\n\\(If we definitely agree not to use imprint@status for kind codes, I wonder whether we should use imprint@status for what is currently on biblStruct@status since that also relates to the publication of the patent.\\)\r\n\r\nLet's say for now that the kind code would be included as the content of some element inside of &lt;imprint&gt;.  Do we use &lt;idno&gt;, as Javier suggests, or &lt;term&gt;, as Kevin suggests?  Javier suggests &lt;idno&gt; because the element definition says \"supplies any form of identifier used to identify some object, such as a bibliographic item, a person, a title, an organization, etc. in a standardized way.\"  Kevin explained in reply that he's only ever known an &lt;idno&gt; used in a way in which the content of this element identifies a \\*single\\* entity, whereas kind codes are actually standardized terms from a typology which don't identify any particular entity.  For that, Kevin feels that &lt;term&gt; is the usual way this is done in TEI \\(at least when they occur inside &lt;keywords&gt; in the header\\).",

        "text": "Regarding the proposal of adding the kindCode as an attribute of the &lt;imprint&gt; I think it is not the best place for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1\\) Most patent authorities issue more than one document for any particular patent. \r\nThese sequential documents often keep the same number, so they are distinguished by adding a letter immediately after the number, called the kind code.\r\nTherefore, the kindCode is an element of the four elements used for identifying a patent document \\(Patent Authority + Patent Number + Date + Kind Code\\). If the kindCode is stored as an attribute of &lt;imprint&gt;, then &lt;imprint&gt; would be an empty element with the information of the kindCode stored as an attribute. This seems to be somehow strange, because we would have an empty &lt;imprint&gt; \\(which is not allowed currently by TEI guidelines\\).\r\n\r\n2\\) Even allowing empty &lt;imprint&gt; the fact of storing the kind code as attribute would restrict possible functionalities like the following: in most of the offices the kind code is composed by one letter and one number \\(for example A2, C1,... For more detailed information see http://www.delphion.com/help/kindcodes\\). The letter and the number carry information about a particular aspect of the current situation of the document, so it could be convenient to encode the kind code as two separate items, the letter and the number. If the kind code is stored as a whole as an attribute, this won\u2019t be possible, but if it is stored as child of &lt;imprint&gt;, then it would be possible to \"fine-grain\" encode separately the letter from the number composing the whole kind code. \r\nAccording to the XML common practice, If the information is expressed in a structured form, especially if the structure may be extensible, the elements should be used. On the other hand: If the information is expressed as an atomic token, the attribute could be used \\(see for example http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-eleatt/index.html\\). In this case, the kind code IS NOT an atomic information, but it is composed in most of cases of one letter and one number which have specific meanings. Therefore, it seems to be more appropriate to store this information as an element, i.e. a child of &lt;imprint&gt;.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, I would store the kind code information as a child of the &lt;imprint&gt; element.\r\n\r\nP.S.: I attach a file with a brief explanation of the kind codes at the European Patent Office. The extended information of the different kind codes in other patent authorities can be found in http://www.delphion.com/help/kindcodes",

        "text": "1\\) Regarding the idea of storing the &lt;date&gt; as child of &lt;imprint&gt; I agree with Kevin and I think it is a good idea. It is important to note that this date refers to the date of filing/publication of the patent, and it is not related to the specific stage of the patent. The application-date is the date when a complete application was received and the publication-date is the date on which the patent application is published \\(i.e. the information is available to public\\) normally 18 months after filing or 18 months after priority date.\r\nSince the &lt;imprint&gt; \"groups information relating to the publication or distribution of a bibliographic item, it seems a good idea to store it there.\r\n\r\n2\\) Regarding the idea of using &lt;classCode&gt;for storing the kindCode, I also agree with Kevin.\r\n\r\n3\\) Regarding the proposal of having status=\"application\u00a6publication\" on\r\n&lt;imprint&gt;, I think it is not a good idea, because there are some bibliographic references to patents WITHOUT the kind Code and date, what would lead us to an empty &lt;imprint&gt;. If we store the status in an attribute of the &lt;imprint&gt;, then we will have a problem for those references which do not have a kind \r\nCode, because it would be an empty &lt;imprint&gt;. Furthermore, the status \\(application\u00a6publication\\) is a property affecting of the whole bibliographic reference and not only of part of it. \r\nTherefore, I still think that the status should be an attribute of &lt;bibliStruct&gt;. \r\n\r\nSo my proposal \\(which is the same as Kevin except for the @status\\), would be:\r\n\r\n&lt;biblStruct type=\"patent\u00a6utilityModel\u00a6designPatent\u00a6plant\" status=\"application\u00a6publication\"&gt;\r\n&lt;monogr&gt;\r\n&lt;authority&gt;\r\n&lt;orgName type=\"national\u00a6regional\"&gt;\\[name of patent office goes\r\nhere\\]&lt;orgName&gt;\r\n&lt;/authority&gt;\r\n&lt;idno type=\"docNumber\"&gt;\\[document number goes here\\]&lt;/idno&gt;\r\n&lt;imprint&gt;\r\n&lt;classCode&gt;\\[kind code goes here\\]&lt;/classCode&gt; &lt;== Note that you could\r\nalso use &lt;catRef&gt; here\\!\r\n&lt;date type=\"\"applicationDate\u00a6publicationDate\"&gt;\\[date goes\r\nhere\\]&lt;/date&gt;\r\n&lt;/imprint&gt;\r\n&lt;/monogr&gt;\r\n&lt;/biblStruct&gt;",

In my opinion we should not let the fact that an &lt;imprint&gt; element would be empty stop us if the encoding would be well structured.\r\n\r\nThat said, I could live with leaving @status on &lt;biblStruct&gt;, especially in order to support other uses of this attribute besides for recording applilcation versus publication.

That's absurd.  As I mentioned in a previous comment, and as can be seen in \"PatentCitationExamples.doc\", patent documents have actual titles, but no one cites them that way.  What's the point of having a placeholder title in the data?  If a style guide for some citation format requires a title for each citation, then the person writing the stylesheet for converting &lt;biblStruct&gt;s to that citation format can construct the required title however it should be created.  Compare this with a citation that lacks a place of publication or publisher: most of us would omit &lt;pubPlace&gt; or &lt;publisher&gt;, and the output would insert \"s.l.\", \"s.n.\", \"n.d.\", \"\\[no date\\]\", etc. in place of the place or publisher.",

Happy to see \"followed by\" replaced by \"and\", but I don't think it addresses the real problem I have with this proposal (which I raised over a year ago) -- namely that it results in a `<title>-free <biblStruct>` which just seems wrong to me.\r\n\r\n2. In the proposed draft text, I see you have something which is formatted to look vaguely like a `<specList>` (hard to be sure since it's in some weird proprietary format) but which doesn't use the standard definitions for the elements. I would strongly recommend rewording this so that it makes clear that this is a list of recommended ways of using these elements in this context.  So for example change \"The following elements are provided for tagging..\" to \"The following TEI elements may be used for tagging...\" and in each case change \"contains\" \"may be used to contain\" vel sim\r\n\r\n3. Using `<classCode>` for this \"kind code\" thingie is fine, but don't you need somewhere to provide an indication of where these codes are defined? e.g. a @source \r\n\r\n4. Happy to see this being added as an example to the existing section. Less happy to see it being a new section: this bloated chapter is already fiendishly over-structured. Also we're not defining any new elements here, just saying how to use existing ones for a spedcific application.\r\n   ",

I agree that it doesn't address any part of this proposal, but the wording there affects what wording is appropriate to use in the text to be inserted.\r\n\r\n2. I also noted the text that looks like a &lt;specList&gt; but which isn't because there is text following each element name that isn't simply the definition of that element as given in the element specification.  So I was thinking of implementing this in a way that is simply a &lt;list&gt;.  Lou's recommended revisions here makes sense.\r\n\r\n3. Yes, that's right.  Jose, can you give me a plausible value of @source for your example for section 3.11.2.2?  You'll also want to be sure to include this in any other documents you are working on (like the page for the TEI wiki).\r\n\r\n4. The fact that the chapter is bloated shouldn't stop us from adding a new section: it just means that someone needs to divide this chapter into two or more.  We shouldn't punish the patent people just because they want to add something which belongs in the bloated chapter.  But I agree with Lou that what we are saying how to use existing elements without defining existing ones, which has given me pause about adding a new section.",

In such a case, understanding that @source \"provides a pointer to the bibliographical source from which a quotation or citation is drawn\", the example for section 3.11.2.2 should have source=\"uspto\" because the example is a citation of a US patent, i.e. the kind code is defined by the USPTO (United States Patent and Trademark Office). Therefore, the example in section 3.11.2.2 should contain:\r\n\r\nclassCode source=\"uspto\"\r\n\r\nRegarding the example in section 3.11.2.3, the example must be also updated with source='epo' because in this case it deals with an European patent application, i.e. the kind code is defined by the EPO (European Patent Office).\r\nTherefore, the example in section 3.11.2.3 should contain:\r\n\r\nclassCode source=\"epo\"\r\n\r\nOnly one further comment/question: I suppose that with the introduction of @source in classCode there is not anymore a need for @scheme (@kevin) is this correct?\r\nIn case @scheme is still needed, I would put in the example of section 3.11.2.2 the value:\r\n\r\nscheme=\"http://www.uspto.gov\"\r\n\r\n...and in section 3.11.2.3 the value:\r\n\r\nscheme=\"http://www.epo.org\"\r\n\r\nPlease Kevin, confirm what is the last format in order to update the document accordingly and to create the WIKI with the right examples.",

  "description": "During the discussion of ID: 3496494, I raised an apparently somewhat controversial point with reference to the following statement:\r\n\r\n\"@from specifies the beginning of the passage being annotated; if not accompanied by a @to attribute, then specifies the entire passage.\" \\[1\\]\r\n\r\n\\[1\\]: http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-span.html\r\n\r\nThis statement licenses using the @from attribute as defining a span, rather than identifying the initial point thereof \\(as an innocent speaker of English would think\\). It seems to me that this is a rather evil example of attribute abuse, even if sanctified by use \\(is it?\\), maybe even more evil for that, because it opens the way to similarly abusing e.g. data.pointer attributes just because they are able to both identify points and identify ranges.\r\n\r\nInstead of using the obligatory @from and optional @to, I would like to suggest introducing an obligatory choice: \\( @from and @to \\) OR @range\r\n\r\nThe new @range \\(data.pointer\\) attribute would do the same job as the @from is now \\(evilly\\) licensed to do, except without any abuse of the semantics. As it is now, actually, @from that refers to a series of characters \\(whatever they are enclosed in\\) is ambiguous: it may indicate that \\(1\\) some word that @from points at is the initial edge of a span, but unfortunately also \\(2\\) that the characters of that element \\*are\\* the span, and its interpretation would only depend on whether @to is missing. Introducing @range would remove this ambiguity.",

But that would only work on the interpretation that we are looking at the end of a container that immediately dominates the target of @from. To use the example from the Guidelines, slightly modified:\r\n\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n&lt;p xml:id=\"para2\"&gt;\\(The \"aftermath\" starts here\\)&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p xml:id=\"para3\"&gt;\\(The \"aftermath\" continues here\\)&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p xml:id=\"para4\"&gt;\\(The \"aftermath\" ends in this paragraph\\)&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;\\!-- ... --&gt;\r\n&lt;p xml:id=\"last\\_para\"&gt;....&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n...\r\n&lt;span type=\"structure\" from=\"\\#para2\"&gt;aftermath&lt;/span&gt;\r\n\r\nThe, I believe, easily derived interpretation of the &lt;span&gt; above is: \"from \\#para2 until the end of the containing &lt;div&gt;\".

This is where one should use e.g. @target, as Martin suggests \\(without bothering about the possible \\(in\\)sane uses of @target, because silliness is beyond our control anyway\\).\r\n\r\nSo I would now suggest to reword the definition of @from to:\r\n\r\n\"specifies the beginning of the passage being annotated; if not accompanied by a @to attribute, then specifies the entire passage from the targeted element to the end of the element that contains it. If a single element should be addressed as the entire span in question, use @target.\"\r\n\r\nThe additional funny thing is that we can theoretically use @from to indicate an inter-character point \\(rather than a single element\\). That should get a separate proviso in the definition.\r\n\r\n\\(I have a feeling that this is not going to be easy...\\)",

  "description": "I ask that the Council please consider changing the datatype of @rend from 1\u2013\u221e occurrences of data.word to simply \"text\". There was a lengthy discussion of this issue on TEI-L recently. Arguments in favor of this change include:\r\n\r\n\u2014It is backwards compatible with current usage. 1\u2013\u221e occurrences of data.word is also valid as Datatype text.\r\n\u2014It supports the use of CSS in @rend. The current Datatype, if one follows both \"the spirit and the letter\" of the Datatype, does not support CSS. \r\n\r\nIt is useful for a markup language to support both references to styles \\(as with the &lt;rendition&gt;/@rendition model\\) and inline styles. There is little point in creating a \"class\" for a style using &lt;rendition&gt; if that style only appears once in a document. There are many other scenarios in which the incline style could be useful.\r\n\r\nThe current Datatype discourages users from using a widely adopted standard \\(CSS\\) in @rend to describe the rendition of an element. And I believe it would be wise for TEI to at least support the use of this standard. Users prefer to describe renditional using a non-standard language, may continue to do so.\r\n\r\nIn the discussion on TEI-L it became clear that a number of users \\(including some current and former members of Council\\) are already using CSS in @rend and advocated official support for this usage. Others acknowledged the benefits of supporting CSS in @rend. There was of course, some dissension, but while some may believe the change is unnecessary, I don't believe anyone argued that it was harmful or dangerous.\r\n\r\nThere was also discussion of establishing a mechanism for declaring how one was using @rend. I believe such a mechanism would be helpful, but is certainly not necessary. I think it's much more important to change the Datatype. The other issue can be sorted out later, and the current &lt;encodingDesc&gt; provides mechanisms for making such declarations.",

Furthermore, the two opposed positions are not entirely the same in terms of their potential negative effects. If people do wish to constrain their @rend values, they can do so by a simple ODD with a vallist and remain conformant; if on the other hand they wished to unconstrain values constrained by the Guidelines this would not be the case. John's suggestion that we need to specify how to process @rend values in the &lt;encodingDesc&gt; is also a good one.  ",

        "text": "I think we're setting up a false dichotomy between 'allow any text' and 'constrain the values'. Currently the Guidelines \\*do\\* make a recommendation on this, and that recommendation is that these are discrete space-separated tokens. That some people are abusing this to add free text is in no way a logical justification for throwing out the existing recommendations.\r\n\r\nYes, people can constrain their @rend values, and I hope they do. If a separate feature request goes in for proposing values that the TEI should suggest for @rend, then that might be helpful in convincing people to standardise \\(but, I accept, is so hard to do because of the nature of what @rend records\\),  \r\n\r\nThe suggestion to have a mechanism to describe how you are using @rend is, however, generally a good one. \\(similar to the mechanism for documenting how one is using private URIs\\). However, if one is already going through that amount of trouble, it seems ludicrous not to use @rendition since it exists specifically for this purpose. Moreover, I still think the proper place to define your list attribute values and what they mean is in the ODD with a valList.\r\n\r\nI like the flexibility given by @rend and believe that the order of these tokens is immaterial. rend=\"big bold beautiful\" should be understood to be the same as rend=\"bold beautiful big\", IMHO.  However, I'm willing to concede that we do not currently specify that. \r\n\r\nI do not in any way buy the argument that @rendition is difficult to use. Encoders can do rendition=\"\\#big \\#bold \\#beautiful\" just as easy. There is no need to immediately define a &lt;rendition&gt; for each of these \\(the file still validates\\), and distinct rendition statements could be easily automatically generated for later processing. \\(However, the same is true for conversion from @rend to @rendition, which is another reason why white-space separation is so meaningful\\).\r\n\r\nLooking at John's arguments here:\r\n1\\) That it is backwards compatible  is not an argument for loosening this up\r\n2\\) I still don't think we should allow inline CSS, it certainly shouldn't be encouraged in @rend because this is expressly for magic tokens understood by the user. If people want to use CSS that is what @rendition is for, and that using that is so very difficult is a great exaggeration.\r\n3\\) It may be useful to allow inline and referenced styles. The way the TEI does this is by having a pointer system to &lt;rendition&gt; and a magic token system where your processing contains the logic as to what is meant by 'bold'. To have a third way just seems unnecessary to me. To suggest that this inline style \\_must\\_ be CSS really is looking towards only certain types of output. If one allows other schemes, then one must document them and we already have a mechanism for that, called &lt;rendition&gt;.\r\n4\\) The current datatype \\*does\\* discourage users from using CSS in @rend, because it is a bad practice and using the much more rigorous @rendition mechanism is a much better idea. \r\n5\\) You believe it would be wise for the TEI to support this standard... and look, it \\*does\\*... that is what &lt;rendition&gt; is for and the way the TEI has chosen to support it. We expressly decided that we did not want free text attribute values, and &lt;rendition&gt; is a consequence of that. If we allow free text in @rend, then why not in @type? And if there why not everywhere else?\r\n6\\) Some people not only believe the change is unnecessary but I believe that I and other argued that it was harmful and dangerous. I think it undoes lots of the good work we did in creating attribute value datatypes in the construction of P5. I feel it weakens the standard and very very significantly hampers interoperability and interchange by legitimising people doing things that are bad practice. I really think this would be a retrograde step and so far haven't seen any convincing arguments for why it is such a good idea.\r\n7\\) As I said above, I wouldn't object to a way to document a scheme by which @rend values were given but do think that as soon as you are going to that much trouble either all you need is a paragraph somewhere in &lt;encodingDesc&gt; or to use @rendition properly.\r\n\r\nSome of my own arguments and answers might be a bit flippant and not entirely rigorous in themselves, for which I apologise, no disrespect is intended.\r\n\r\nAgain, these are just my person opinions and I'd abide by whatever council decided, but the first customisation I would make \\(and I think most projects \\*SHOULD\\* make\\) is to constrain @rend to be a tight set of agreed values.",

That multiple occurrences of data.word are also valid as data.text seems like just the reverse of the problem we have now. Currently, white space used in a phrase as the value of @rend is syntactically valid, because each word in the phrase is assumed to be a single token. As James has written elsewhere:\n\n\"if someone marks up a text using:\n\n&lt;hi rend=\u201dIt looks a bit like that other one\u201d&gt;text&lt;/hi&gt;\n\nThis actually has 8 tokens \u201cIt\u201d, \u201clooks\u201d, \u201ca\u201d, \u201cbit\u201d, \u201clike\u201d, \u201cthat\u201d, \u201cother\u201d, \u201cone\u201d. The point is that the whitespace between these words in the attribute make these each separate values or tokens, not a phrase.\"\n\nIf we changed the datatype to data.text, don't we get just the opposite problem? &lt;hi rend=\"orange tall bold\"&gt; will now be interpreted as one token instead of three? That is, by changing to data.text, we make valid and meaningful something that used to be @rend abuse. But don't we also render meaningless \\(if still syntactically valid\\) something that used to be the proper use of @rend? \n\nThe use of CSS inline also makes me a bit anxious because I have a hard time believing that it will really be used to capture what a source document looks like, and now how the encoder wants it to be rendered online. Using CSS to capture what is on a page seems convenient but somehow abusive. I think CSS belongs between the marked up text and the browser, not between the page and the marked up text. I'm not sure we want to encourage its use on @rend. ",

If we have to decide for one or the other, I think it's only fair that those who are using @rend correctly \\(by which I mean \\*as described\\* currently\\) continue to be able to do so, and those who have to date been abusing it should have the opportunity to make their XML compliant TEI again by changing to a new attribute.\r\n\r\n\\(If someone came up with evidence that 90% of people abuse this attribute and only 10% use it correctly, I suppose that would be an argument for the new attribute to be the space-delimited tokens datatype, and @rend change to allowing \\[only?\\] CSS.

The @proposed:style allows anything in it from magic tokens to CSS.  When should they use one of these over the other? It is fairly clear when to use @rend \\(a quick approximate inline categorisation\\) and @rendition \\(no, we really care about being more precise so are going to measure things and do it properly\\). It seems less clear, to me, when to use style. If you are going to the effort to care that much about the original rendition to measure it, then recording it in the header is hardly a stumbling block and much better practice that we should encourage. If you would put @style=\"font-weight:bold;\" then I would argue that this is bad practice. Either @rend=\"bold\" is enough or pointing to the header is easy enough since you really care about the degree of boldness \\(which is something CSS is quite bad at recording\\!\\).  If people really want a way to add one specific language \\(CSS\\) inline, then I think they should be defining their own attribute @my:style and then canonicalising this back to @rendition when they are done.\r\n\r\nAnother thing that bothers me about this is that a lot of new people will look at this, assume it is like @html:style, and that it is to be used for \\*output\\* stylistic information.  I hope that we can agree that recording output stylistic information in a TEI file is nonsensical. \\(Since there may be hundreds of different outputs.\\)  \\(Note: I don't feel the same about recording multiple potential output possibilities in a processing stylesheet pointed to be &lt;equiv&gt; in the ODD for any particular document instance.

        "text": "It seems we have two camps here, the Champions of CSS, or CoCCS \\(pronounced, \"cocks\"\\), and the Defenders of Antiquated Token Systems, or DoATS \\(rhymes with \"boats\"\\).  I am, of course, one of the CoCCS.\r\n\r\nLike Gabby and Sebastian, I support the compromise @style. I would strongly recommend that it \\*not\\* be defined as containing inline css \\*only\\*.  HTML's @style is \\(wisely, I think\\) not restricted to CSS: \"This attribute specifies style information for the current element.\" And HTML has a mechanism for \"setting the default style sheet language,\" e.g., &lt;META http-equiv=\"Content-Style-Type\" content=\"text/css\"&gt;. But the style language does not have to be CSS. In practice, it always is, but the HTML spec wisely does not lock the attribute into a single style language. When a new style language comes along, HTML does not have to create yet another style-related attribute \\(as TEI would be doing with a new @style\\).  Instead, one simply needs to declare an alternative default style language. \r\n\r\nWe have a perfectly good @rend attribute that could be used similarly and support tokens \\*or\\* CSS \\(certainly not both within the same document\\).  I believe it would be much preferable to define a system to declare the default values of @rend and let people use it as they will, which is what they do now. Council would be improving the current situation tremendously by providing a mechanism to define exactly what is in @rend.  Such a mechanism could indicate unambiguously the style language being used in @rend. It could be something like the &lt;taxonomy&gt; element that includes a &lt;bibl&gt; that could include a link to the CSS standard or to a document that defines tokens that are used, e.g., 'bold' = 'font-weight:bold'. \r\n\r\n\\*But\\* there is clearly a strong contingent of users who would like to restrict @rend values to non-standard tokens, and if they are not to be persuaded to\r\ndesist \\(as it seems they are not\\), then if the choice is between \\(ab\\)using\r\n@rend for CSS or introducing a new attribute which supports CSS \\(and potentially/hopefully other style languages\\), then I'm for the new @style attribute. But please keep @style flexible, and don't lock it into CSS. It should be an inline equivalent for @rendition, which is not restricted to CSS.\r\n\r\nAs for the need for inline style information, consider this use case: A modernist text composed in collage fashion with letters cut from magazines and newspapers.  Every character on the page has a distinct font family, font size, style, etc. The style of each character is unique in the document. It seems entirely reasonable that one would want to  use a &lt;c&gt; element for each character and an inline @rend \\(or if we must, @style\\) to define the rendition of each character. The @rendition pointing system works great for \\*classes\\* of styles that are reused. It doesn't make much sense for unique renditions such as we find in this use case.\r\n\r\nThanks again to Council for their thoughtful consideration of this issue.\r\n\r\nJohn",

The @style attribute used in XHTML is not in the HTML namespace, according to my understanding of how attributes and namespaces work. We can create an attribute called style and say that it's the same as the one in the XHTML spec, but we can't directly use their style attribute.\r\n\r\nThat's different from something like @xlink:href, which as I understand it is explicitly defined in a namespace, perhaps for the specific purpose of allowing it to be used in other specifications. Ditto @xml:lang and friends.\r\n\r\nSomeone please correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe this is the case. If it is, then we must stop talking about @html:style, and accept that we will be creating our own attribute.",

        "text": "I hope there's room for both Cocss and Doats in TEI Land. For me \\(and everyone I've discussed this issue with\\)  the real concern is that we make it easier for people to be explicit as to which club they're in.  Hence, reluctantly, I am coming round to the view that we shouldn't change the current definition of @rend, but instead introduce a new @style attribute. Making explicitness easier also involves being able to give a better explanation for why we would now have three \\(count em, 3\\) different ways of indicating the appearance of the source document \\(something, we say elsewhere, the TEI is not that interested in\\!\\). Here's my post hoc rationalisation:\r\n1\\. sometimes people want to use their own token-based informal tags ; especially so for legacy encodings. That's what @rend is for,\r\n2\\. sometimes people want to use a formally-defined rendition language \\(FDRL\\)and specify its value element by element \\(some good use cases for that in this thread\\) -- that's what the new @style attribute  is for. It contains an expression in a FDRL. Which particular FDRL we are using should be defined somewhere in the &lt;encodingDesc&gt; \r\n3\\. sometimes they want to do the same thing, but make life easier by defining macros for particular strings of FDRL which are then referenced element by element -- that's what the existing @rendition  is for. It points to a &lt;rendition&gt; element which defines expressions in the chosen FDRL. \r\n\r\nFinally, I think we could make all this a lot clearer if we renamed @rendition as @styleRef, and &lt;rendition&gt; as &lt;styleDesc&gt;. To avoid the wrath of Birnbaum we might add those names as new ones, and retain the old names with a deprecation flag of some sort.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne further point though. @rendition",

My suggestion still stands to link from \"Version 2.1.0\" to http://www.tei-c.org/Guidelines/P5/\\#previous , which already lists past releases and from which a user can find the release notes if they know where to look.

Hence I think that the @keepHyphen proposal could be replaced with something which purports to describe the nature of the hyphen in the original text, either using distinct Unicode characters, or some other XML markup. For practical reasons, I would also recommend that any XML markup to describe a hyphen should enclose it rather than follow it, because this is a more natural use of XML.\n",

An encoder is free to adopt this interpretation and encode it with &lt;g/&gt;. It can be easily enough applied in most circumstances. It does not depend on context or on encoding practices (e.g. it can be used even when &lt;lb/&gt;s as such are not captured). And it can easily be converted into other solutions should that be needed.\r\n\r\nMartin's suggestion that the difference between a hyphenated and unhyphenated form might be encoded with &lt;orig&gt; and &lt;reg&gt; within &lt;choice&gt; is theoretically fine, but tends to run aground on the difficulties of coping with the intervening element (e.g. &lt;lb/&gt; &lt;pb/&gt; &lt;cb&gt;)\r\n\r\nThe original suggestion that an attribute be defined whose semantics characterize the immediately preceding hyphen feels very kludgy, antithetical to the spirit of XML, and likely to lead to confusing situations. What happens when the attribute is present but the hyphen has been omitted? what happens when a series of elements intervene between the two halves of a word? (e.g. beau|&lt;figure/\\>&lt;cb/&gt;tiful). What happens when there is no element at all between the first and second half of the word, as happens frequently in connection with notated music (\"O Ca -- na -- da\"), and involves what seems to be exactly the same kind of contingent hyphen, albeit one without intervening line, column, or page break?",

  "description": "The &lt;timeLine&gt; element allows us to talk about something which takes place over a period of time, and lets us\r\ntalk about points within that period, using &lt;when&gt;. However, this does not let us talk about \\_chunks\\_ of the timeline.\r\nI'd like to use such a thing to link a text to an audio or video rendering of it \\(a performance of a play, for example\\). Thus\r\nI have a poem with 8 lines, and 60 seconds of audio of the poet reading it. I'd like to note that line 2 can be linked to the\r\naudio, the point between 8 seconds in and 15 seconds in. I have in the past abused &lt;when&gt; by adding @from/@to attributes\r\nto it, which works fine, but it would be good to have this done cleanly. One \\_could\\_ define stretches of time by defining &lt;when&gt;s for the start and\r\nthe end, but this is cumbersome, and does not provide a unit to link to.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion is to add a new empty element &lt;chunk&gt; or &lt;stretch&gt; or &lt;anothername&gt;, which can occur as a child of &lt;tlmeline&gt;, freely\r\ninterspersed with &lt;when&gt;s, and with attributes @from, @to, and @unit.\r\n\r\nI'd also be just as happy if &lt;when&gt; was re-defined to allow us to talk about stretches of time, by adding @from and @to.\r\n",

For the record, I append below part of the message I sent to the stand-off markup gang, which initiated  quite a discussion in the last week:\r\n\r\nI am currently finalizing the ISO 24611 document on Morphosyntactic annotation, where we have a proprietary notation for stand-off with character offset \\(see example blow\\) and for which I would like to present a TEI based alternative syntax. My assumption is that if TEI and ISO could speak the same language, we would probably be more likely to get some implementation \\(we could even communicate on this\\).\r\nhttp://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/SA.html\\#SATSSR seems the appropriate means to do what I want here, but there is no paragraph in the guidelines \\(with an example\\) eliciting its use for stand-off mark-up. To my view, the semantic is clear here \\(the &lt;w&gt; should be used as containing the corresponding string, further reference to the source is possible \\(e.g. to get its metadata, etc.\\); but I would not want to have this discussion opend now at the expense of losing track of the request\\).\r\n\r\nSo, given the example below, I would be delighted if you could provide guidance on:\r\n\\- telling me if the use of @coresp is appropriate,  if not provide a stable alternative\r\n\\- telling me if the syntax for the pointer is appropriate, if not provide a s table alternative\r\n\\- considering if the guidelines should be more pushy in recommending this \\(I would then open a ticket accordingly\\)\r\n\r\nWe really suffer from not offering a ready made character based stand-off mechanism to the NLP community.

  "description": "We occasionally claim that existing TEI elements are able to support most simple kinds of standoff markup. This is nearly but not quite true: we could improve the situation by simplifying and generalising the existing &lt;span&gt; element to indicate the bounds of any span of text.\r\n\r\nA span can be defined in one of three  ways : \r\n\\(a\\) &lt;span from=\"\\#E1\"/&gt; i.e. the span is coterminous with another element E1 \r\n\\(b\\) &lt;span from=\"\\#E1\" to=\"\\#E2\"/&gt;  the span is coterminous with the sequence of elements or element fragments found in a document between two elements E1 and E2 \r\nThese two methods exist in the Guidelines already. What is lacking is some way of indicating a \\*discontinuous\\* span, for example in the sentence \"you couldn't make it up\", we want to show that the words \"make\" and \"up\" can be regarded as  a span \\(the verb \"make up\"\\) even though they are discontinuous. The suggestion is to do this by adding a new attribute @target to the &lt;span&gt; element \\(more exactly, by adding &lt;span&gt; to att.pointing\\) . This would give us\r\n\\(c\\) &lt;span target=\"\\#E1 \\#E2\"/&gt; indicating that the span is made by  aggregating the content of the elements E1 and E2 \\(which are not necessarily continuous\\)\r\n\r\nIt may be objected that this third case is already catered for by the existing &lt;join&gt; element. And certainly the same effect could be obtained by something like &lt;join target=\"\\#E1 \\#E2\" result=\"span\"/&gt; But this has the serious disadvantage of requiring us to tag cases like \"you couldn't make it up\" quite differently from \"let's make up something\". Occam's razor suggests that extending &lt;span&gt; is the better course.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of other issues to do with whether or not similar effects could be achieved by some improvement in pointer syntax, as per current TEI-SOM discussions, but the present proposal is intended just to deal with the simple case where each of the components of a span can be pointed to directly using good old fashioned identifiers as shown here.\r\n",

It is really my notes in thinking about it because it takes me 5 minutes \\_just\\_ to get my head around the content models of person/place/org.\r\n\r\nThe current content models, excluding attributes and attribute classes are:\r\n\r\nperson: \\( model.pLike+ | \\( model.personPart | model.global \\)\\* \\)\r\n\r\nplace: \\(model.headLike\\*,  \\(\\(model.pLike\\*\\) | \\(model.labelLike | model.placeStateLike | model.placeEventLike\\)\\*\\), \\(model.noteLike | model.biblLike | idno | linkGrp | link \\)\\*, \\(model.placeLike | listPlace \\)\\*\r\n\r\norg:  \\(model.headLike\\*, \\(\\(model.pLike\\*\\) | \\(model.labelLike | model.nameLike | model.placeLike | model.orgPart\\)\\*\\),\\(model.noteLike | model.biblLike | linkGrp | link\\)\\*, model.personLike\\*\\)\r\n\r\nand for reference:\r\n\r\nmodel.personPart: model.persStateLike \\[persName affiliation age education faith floruit langKnowledge nationality occupation residence sex socecStatus state trait\\] model.persEventLike \\[birth death event\\] idno bibl\r\n\r\nmodel.nameLike: model.nameLike.agent \\[name orgName persName\\] model.offsetLike \\[offset geogFeat\\] model.placeStateLike \\[model.placeNamePart \\[placeName bloc country region district settlement geogName\\] climate location population state terrain trait\\] model.persNamePart \\[surname forename genName nameLink addName roleName\\] idno rs lang\r\n\r\nmodel.labelLike: desc label\r\n\r\nmodel.placeNamePart: \\[placeName bloc country region district settlement geogName\\] climate location population state terrain trait\r\n\r\nmodel.placeEventLike: event\r\n\r\nmodel.orgPart: listOrg listPerson listPlace\r\n\r\n\r\nEverytime I spend 5 minutes trying to untangle this, my head starts hurting. the reason for the grouping in org and place is so you can have either &lt;head&gt; followed by zero-or-more &lt;p&gt; \\_or\\_ zero-or-more structure content, and either of those followed by zero-or-more note/bibls/embeddedPlacesOrgs/etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nProposal:\r\n\r\n\r\nperson/personGrp: \\( model.pLike+ | \\(model.personPart | model.nameLike | model.global \\)\\*\\)  -- i.e. add nameLike and simplify model.personPart or persStateLike so that it doesn't conflict with model.nameLike \\(e.g. remove idno and others that it will get from model.naming\\)\r\n\r\nplace: \\(model.headLike\\*,  \\(\\(model.pLike\\*\\) | \\(model.nameLike |model.labelLike | model.placeEventLike\\)\\*\\), \\(model.noteLike | model.biblLike | idno | linkGrp | link \\)\\*, \\(model.placeLike | listPlace \\)\\*\r\n\\- i.e. retain head and p vs structured distinction, replace model.placeStateLike by model.nameLike \\(since this contains it\\) Problem: idno is in nameLike and here. If we remove it, then you can't do &lt;head&gt; followed by &lt;p&gt; followed by &lt;idno&gt;... but this is what org is like and so would be consistent with that. If we did that \\(and I'd recommend it\\) it would look like:\r\nplace: \\(model.headLike\\*,  \\(\\(model.pLike\\*\\) | \\(model.nameLike |model.labelLike | model.placeEventLike\\)\\*\\), \\(model.noteLike | model.biblLike | linkGrp | link \\)\\*, \\(model.placeLike | listPlace \\)\\*  I don't think there is a backwards compatibility problem really, since we just added it in this very release.\r\n\r\n\r\norg: \\(model.headLike\\*, \\(\\(model.pLike\\*\\) | \\(model.labelLike | model.nameLike | model.placeLike | model.orgPart\\)\\*\\),\\(model.noteLike | model.biblLike | linkGrp | link\\)\\*, model.personLike\\*\\) - i.e. keep the same.\r\n\r\n\r\nA more radical proposal would be to make org/place more like name and remove the note/bibl/link things from being allowed with just prose paragraphs. i.e. if you want to do that you must use structured information. Person's content model could do with some expanding to bring it in parallel with org/place \\(but again without the need for embedded person\\).\r\n\r\nJust thinking aloud, but would welcome any comments.\r\n\r\n-James\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Municipalities also fall into groups \\(the Capital Regional District is an amalgamation of several municipalities around Victoria\\). \r\n\r\nWould it be helpful to have a generic &lt;entity&gt; element, with &lt;entityGrp&gt;, and a simple common structure, on which &lt;person&gt;, &lt;place&gt; etc. can build?\r\n\r\nI know we can't really do inheritance in the true object-oriented sense in our system, so maybe this is a feature for P6, but it might be a helpful way of thinking about the problem.",

While in many situations that heading is simply the name, and you could therefore use one of the naming elements, you might have headings that contain something more than a name.\r\n\r\nAnyway, if we're going to allow `<note>`, `<bibl>`, and `<idno>` after `<p>` in `<place>`, I don't see why you wouldn't also allow this in `<person>`.  For example, a prosopography might give an ID for each person after the prose biographical info about the person, and the encoder might not consider this ID to be part of the paragraph.",

For the record, I believe the decision to make org, person, place NOT datable was a conscious one: they are grouping elements, and you would look at their child elements (all of which are datable) to decide what the relevant dates should be. An org that is founded in 1860 should have an &lt;event type=\"founding\"> for example. Likewise, if you allow &lt;person> or &lt;place> to be datable you introduce the possiblty of a contradiction between the dates on it and (say) on birth and death children.

Consequently all of its elements appear in your schema which can be quite a surprise. So the answer to your last question is \"a bit of both really\".... Since class changes often affect elements not included in the module where those classes are not defined, I don't think an ODD processor should take a reference to a class in module x as a licence to load all the definitions for module x as well. \\(Roma presumably has no choice in this respect though, cos it does everything by exclusion.

That, however, can be easily controlled, and one can argue that the option not to expand the includes may be an advantage sometimes.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it may be easy to make a pass across the Guidelines with XQuery or XSLT \\(and --include switched off\\) to prepare a map of inclusions. That is harder to do in the current system, where the parser doesn't see the entity invocations by definition \\(you'd need Perl or something like that\\).\r\n\r\nHave I overlooked something serious?\r\n\r\nWell, the floor is open for discussion.",

There was a column with several items, each beginning on a new line, like what you'd get in HTML with &lt;ul&gt; and CSS of list-style-type:none\r\n\r\nIn 3.7, the example given of rend=\"runon\" encodes a paragraph where the list items appeared in running prose, sentence after sentence. The type attribute was \"ordered\" and indeed in the source, the listed sentences were preceded by numbers. \r\n\r\nIs it really the case that TEI's \"@type values really are presentational\"? It seems the current values are a mix of semantics and presentation but more semantics than presentation -- and should be 100% semantic.\r\n\r\nI wonder: In say a header field where a &lt;list&gt; is a list of phone numbers, I might be comfortable saying the list is unordered. But if encoding a printed source, to mark a list as unordered would be to add interpretation. Those \"simple\" lists in the Guidelines encode Robinson Crusoe's lists of good and bad things about his situation. The lists were not numbered, but it would be an interpretation to say the author intended nothing significant by the order of presentation.",

The TEI, just like most library cataloging practice, conflates various aspects of works, expressions, manifestations, and items.  \\(I explored this topic briefly a few years ago: see http://www.ultraslavonic.info/preprints/20081102.pdf .\\)",

        "text": "Even though I initially supported greater alignment of TEI with ISBD and lent support to the proposal behind this ticket when it was raised on TEI-L, after some consideration I've decided that this change would be so disruptive to past encoding practice that I we should not break backwards compatibility just to align TEI and ISBD.  In other words, while an alignment would be elegant, it has little practical value.  That is, I no longer support \\(b\\).\r\n\r\nAs for \\(a\\), while I wrote in a previous comment on this ticket that there might be a justification for this, I think the proposed distinction is complicated for users, not reflected elsewhere in the content model of &lt;fileDesc&gt; and &lt;biblFull&gt;, and doesn't really serve a purpose.  So I no longer support \\(a\\) either.\r\n\r\nSo, with apologies for changing my mind so much, I no longer support implementing the proposal in this ticket.  :\\(  More detail below for those interested.\r\n\r\nI propose we give Peter and others a few weeks to respond before closing the ticket without implementing.\r\n\r\n== Background ==\r\n\r\nThe ISBD was developed as an international standard for the structure of library catalog records.  By using standard punctuation marks to separate various components of a bibliographic citation, a librarian could read a citation even if they do not understand the language of the work or even the script it is written in.  Furthermore, such descriptions could be read by users in any country.\r\n\r\nISBD catalog records generally describe a FRBR manifestation \\(all identical copies of a particular edition\\), but for rare books the record describes a FRBR item \\(a particular copy\\).  However, in either case there may be parts of the record that describe the FRBR work \\(\"Hamlet\"\\).  Furthermore, since a published manifestation often include information related to other manifestations of the same FRBR expression \\(such as the edited text used in both the 1962 paperback and hardback editions of Hamlet from Oxford University Press\\), the catalog record also contains information related to the manifestation.  However, these four FRBR entities are not explicitly distinguished in the catalog record.\r\n\r\nIn library practice, the object of cataloging is a whole monograph or serial publication even when published or bound in multiple volumes.  In certain cases a single volume in a monograph, a special issue in a serial, or even an article in a serial will be \"analyzed\" on its own, yielding its own catalog record that refers to the object containing it, much like a TEI &lt;biblStruct&gt; can have an &lt;analytic&gt; or &lt;series&gt; in addition to a &lt;monogr&gt;.\r\n\r\nBoth &lt;fileDesc&gt; and &lt;biblFull&gt; are based on ISBD, which is organized as follows \\(adapted from Wikipedia\\):\r\n\r\n1: title and statement of responsibility area, with the contents of:\r\n1.1 Title proper\r\n1.2 General material designation. \\(GMDs are generic terms describing the medium of the item.\\)\r\n1.3 Parallel title\r\n1.4 Other title information\r\n1.5 Statements of responsibility \\(authorship, editorship, etc.\\)\r\n2: edition area\r\n3: material or type of resource specific area \\(for example, the scale of a map or the numbering of a periodical\\)\r\n4: publication, production, distribution, etc., area\r\n5: physical description area \\(for example: number of pages in a book or number of CDs issued as a unit\\)\r\n6: series area\r\n7: notes area\r\n8: resource identifier \\(e.g. ISBN, ISSN\\) and terms of availability area\r\n\r\nAs explained in the chapter before section 3.11.1 of the Guidelines, \"The order of child elements in both &lt;biblFull&gt; and &lt;fileDesc&gt; corresponds to the order of bibliographic desription \u2018areas\u2019 in ISBD with two minor exceptions. First, the &lt;extent&gt; element, corresponding to the physical description area in ISBD, appears just after the publication, production, distribution, etc. area in ISBD, not before it as in TEI. Second, &lt;biblFull&gt; and &lt;fileDesc&gt; use the child element &lt;publicationStmt&gt; to cover not only the publication, production, distribution, etc. area but also the resource identifier and terms of availability area associated with that publication.\"\r\n\r\n== The problem ==\r\n\r\nIf you want to include an identifier \\*for a bibliographic item\\* in a &lt;biblStruct&gt; or &lt;biblFull&gt;, it's not clear how to do it, and the content models of these elements seem less aligned than you might expect.\r\n\r\nFor a discussion of the problems with &lt;biblStruct&gt;, see http://purl.org/TEI/FR/3565878.\r\n\r\nCurrently there is only one plausible location for an identifier for a bibliographic item in &lt;biblFull&gt;:\r\n\r\nbiblFull/publicationStmt/idno\r\n\r\nThis ticket asks to allow:\r\n\r\nbiblFull/idno\r\n\r\nThere are two arguments for implementing this ticket:\r\n\r\nA\\) It would align the content model of &lt;biblFull&gt; with that of &lt;bibl&gt; and &lt;biblStruct&gt; so that &lt;idno&gt; is allowed as a child of any of them.  This is a weak argument since very little about the content models of &lt;bibl&gt;, &lt;biblStruct&gt;, and &lt;biblFull&gt; is parallel.\r\n\r\nB\\) By allowing &lt;idno&gt; as the last child of &lt;biblFull&gt; and &lt;fileDesc&gt;, we could make TEI follow ISBD's order and hierarchy of components.  While there's a certain elegance to that, it then raises the question whether we would deprecate use of &lt;idno&gt; inside &lt;publicationStmt&gt; altogether in order to conform to the ISBD model.  This would be a major break of backwards compatibility, and I feel that the elegance of aligning TEI and ISBD doesn't warrant this.\r\n\r\nAnother possibility would be to allow &lt;idno&gt; in both places but to make a distinction in how to interpret the markup depending on its location.  We might say that an identifier related to the act of publication \\(or assigned for purposes of publication\\) -- that is, assigned to a FRBR manifestation -- would go in &lt;publicationStmt&gt; whereas an identifier assigned to a FRBR work or FRBR expression would go in an &lt;idno&gt; that is a sibling of &lt;publicationStmt&gt;.  However, the distinction between these FRBR entities is already difficult for most users, and it's not used elsewhere in TEI or ISBD.  There is already considerably confusion about which components of an ISBD record refer to which FRBR entities \\(as explained in the background section above\\) and which components of a TEI header refer to which FRBR entities \\(see http://www.ultraslavonic.info/preprints/20081102.pdf \\), and this one change won't fix that.",

You could even do something like this:\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; &lt;keywords xml:id=\"uncontrolled\" scheme=\"\\#uncontrolled\"&gt;\r\n&gt; &lt;term&gt;ceremonials&lt;/term&gt;\r\n&gt; &lt;term&gt;fairs&lt;/term&gt;\r\n&gt; &lt;term&gt;street life&lt;/term&gt;\r\n&gt; &lt;/keywords&gt;\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; But I still think it would be better, even in \"uncontrolled\" or \r\n&gt; \"unknown\" cases, to point to a &lt;taxonomy&gt; element with a bit more \r\n&gt; explanation. To my \\(admittedly simple\\) mind, \"uncontrolled\" is not \r\n&gt; relevant here. if one has created or documented a list of keywords, then \r\n&gt; one is in possession of a \"controlled\" vocabulary. The list of possible \r\n&gt; values has been restricted or controlled. The distinction, I think, is \r\n&gt; not one of controlled or uncontrolled but  the authority behind the \r\n&gt; control: a standards body or similar organization, a project, an \r\n&gt; individual, etc.\r\n\r\nOn 8/3/12 2:19 PM, Peter Gorman wrote:\r\n&gt; This may be splitting hairs, but then I'm a librarian. ;-\\) Two distinct scenarios, however, have been observed in the wild:\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; 1. A project has developed a fixed vocabulary from which keywords have been chosen, and applied as necessary to specific items. The vocabulary is a local one, but it has been documented.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; 2. No project vocabulary was developed or even contemplated; keywords were applied ad hoc as the encoder saw fit in the moment.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; To me, 'scheme' implies some degree of prior definition and control: something that could be used again. A simple list of words, just by the fact of their existence, is certainly a set, but I'd find it useful to know that it's a completely idiosyncratic one, not likely to be consistent with that in any other document. Put another way, \"local\" as a scheme type is meaningful to me if it's local to an institution or project, but not if it's local to the inside of someone's head at a particular point in time. I'm taking @scheme as analogous to MODS @authority. The DLF MODS guidelines recognize this distinction, but recommend omitting the attribute if the terms are uncontrolled.\r\n\r\nOn 8/3/12 2:49 PM, Michael Piotrowski wrote:\r\n&gt; I agree, but I think it may be useful to differentiate between two types\r\n&gt; of control here:\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; a\\) In a controlled vocabulary the keywords are controlled.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; b\\) In an uncontrolled vocabulary, the keywords may not be controlled,\r\n&gt;     but other aspects may still be controlled, in particular, the\r\n&gt;     language of the keywords, their number \\(e.g., \"at least 3, but no\r\n&gt;     more than 5\"\\), their part of speech \\(e.g., \"use only singular nouns,\r\n&gt;     no verbs, please\"\\), etc.  Conventions such as these could also be\r\n&gt;     considered a scheme, and it may make sense to document them.",

Instead, we took the language directly from the XML spec: \r\n\r\ndefault: signals that the application's default white-space processing modes are acceptable\r\npreserve: indicates the intent that applications preserve all white space\r\n\r\nThe meaningful difference here is in the explanation for default. I think the version we used is preferable to John's above because it is clear that an application's handling of whitespace is based on its default behavior \\(as opposed to an undefined notion of \"appropriate\"\\).\r\n\r\nBased on the comments on the other ticket, we added a note suggesting somewhat ominously/cryptically  that many parsers don't handle xml:space correctly. But now I don't think that sentence is sufficient enough to be useful. I thought of adding something like \"Therefore, although xml:space signals an intention about whitespace, it cannot guarantee that whitespace really will be handled as indicated\" but that seemed redundant. \r\n\r\nJohn's suggested note above certainly clarifies the situation, but to me it feels quite heavy-handed for an attribute spec. It seems like the spec should indicate what is allowed, and not, but not comment on how typical it is to use this attribute. If we incorporate this language I recommend that we instead add it to the prose in 1.3.1.1.4 of the Guidelines.",

If the encoding team and the stylesheet writers are working closely enough together and everyone is willing to take a try-this-and-see-what-happens, we'll-find-workarounds-when-something-breaks approach, the mines can be circumvented. \n\nBut the situation is then precarious. If another team tries reading those TEI file, things can blow up. Indeed, after I broached this on the mailing list, I got a message from someone saying: Wow, thanks\\! Now I see why we had a whole bunch of what we thought were fine TEI files get subtly but then irreversibly corrupted in a transfer to a new system.\n\nThe situation is even more precarious given the conventions that have developed among \\(I'd say most\\) XSL programmers -- conventions that mis-process TEI files. So the best practice now is: If you XML encoders are assuming some specific space handling, you darn well better tell us programmers what it is.\n\nThe second problem is that examples in the Guidelines \\*universally assume space will get processed a certain way and this is nowhere documented\\*. I think that is a big problem. \n\nI got to all of this because I got bit. I am writing a stylesheet intended to work with TEI files I don't control. I finally figured out that those files were expecting me to do something I wasn't doing and which was nowhere documented. It took me long to figure out the unspecified algorithm. It's a standard algorithm, but it took me long to find.\n\nThe best practice for definers of XML vocabularies is to tell producers how space is to be encoded and tell producers what that is or, if that can't be standardized \\(I think it easily can be for TEI, as the examples in the Guidelines indicate\\) then provide a mechanism for the coordination.",

The article features both as a component of \"Cults of Boetia\" and of \"Herakles to Poseidon\". The proposed changes imply a hierarchy, so that it's tempting to regard \"C of B\"  as a component of \"HtoP\" rather than a sibling of it, but this is not warranted. Indeed, it may actually be wrong: the presence of two &lt;imprint&gt;s may just imply that the article in question has been published twice.  This case is indeed the first one cited in the present Guidelines. \r\n\r\nThe relation between a &lt;monogr&gt; and a sibling &lt;series&gt; is a special case, explicitly addressed in the current Guidelines, but it would also \\(theoretically\\) at least fall foul of the same problem, if for example \"C of B\" were included in more than one series. \r\n\r\nI think the sentence \"Each &lt;biblScope&gt; describes where \\(within its parent element\\) to find the thing in the previous level\" is correct, but only if you understand the word \"level\" as \"preceding sibling of a different bibliographic level\"\r\n",

My memory is unfortunately already hazy, but here is my attempt to recall what we decided.\r\n\r\nWhile &lt;biblScope&gt; introduces quite a bit of internal structure in a citation, the relationship among &lt;analytic&gt;, &lt;monogr&gt;, and &lt;series&gt; elements in the Guidelines now isn't quite as described by Gabby, and his proposal for how they should relate \\(to the \"previous level\"\\) doesn't account for the case given in the most recent comment on the ticket.  That is, right now the Guidelines say that if you have one &lt;analytic&gt; and multiple &lt;monogr&gt;, it means that the analytic item appears in both of these &lt;monogr&gt;s, and if you have a &lt;series&gt;, then it relates only to the \"most recently preceding\" &lt;monogr&gt;.\r\n\r\nSo Lou suggested that we make no further modifications.

Right now, the only sensible element to use for this is &lt;biblScope&gt;, but if you use this, there's no recommended way to distinguish, say, a &lt;biblScope&gt; for the range of pages for a whole article in a journal issue and another &lt;biblScope&gt; for the two pages in a row from which a quotation is taken. This distinction is quite important for certain applications; for example, if you want to parse tagged citations to query against CrossRef's database to return a DOI for that item, you only want to send a page range for the whole article, not any particular pages that happen to be cited in your work.\r\n\r\nThat is, how do you cite a part of an &lt;analytic&gt; item, or a part of a &lt;monogr&gt; that doesn't have an &lt;analytic&gt;?\r\n\r\nOur recommendation is:\r\n\r\nA\\) to put this page range in a new element, &lt;citedRange&gt;\\(\\*\\), which would be a child of &lt;biblStruct&gt; \\(and sibling of &lt;analytic&gt;, &lt;monogr&gt;, and &lt;series&gt;\\).

This has the disadvantage of being less obviously distinct in usage \\(and therefore in definition\\) from &lt;biblScope&gt;, but careful explanation and choice of examples may mitigate this.\r\n\r\nC\\) use &lt;biblScope&gt; and an attribute to represent these semantics instead of new element. However this is potentially confusing, in that it encodes two rather different semantics in  a single element. Also, a new attribute would be necessary, since @type is already used and would still be needed \\(what if you want to cite lines or columns or chapters rather than pages?\\).

  "summary": "retaining punctuation marks in the text of a TEI document",
  "description": "Section 3.2.1 \\(\\#COPU-1\\) of P5 discusses the question of whether punctuation marks should be excluded from or left as part of the text in a TEI document.  But no guidance is given on whether and how to record such decisions made.  A few requests arising from this:\r\n\r\n1\\. The &lt;quotation&gt; element \\(within &lt;editorialDecl&gt;\\) should be mentioned here in section 3.2.1.  \\(It is already explained in section 2.3.3 \\(\\#HD53\\).\r\n\r\n2\\. Since the default value of quotation@marks is \"all\", which indicates \"all quotation marks have been retained\", it seems that the TEI's default guidance in this matter is to retain them.  It would be good to say this in section 3.2.1 as well.  The reason, I think, is quite simple: it simplifies rendering of the encoded text for readers if you don't have to reinsert the punctuation.  Encouraging consistency aids interoperability.\r\n\r\n3\\. It would be good to give guidance on whether punctuation marks should be inside or outside containing elements.  Here's an example:\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;She said, &lt;said&gt;\u201cNobody uses the term &lt;soCalled&gt;\u2018electronic text\u2019&lt;/soCalled&gt; anymore\u201d&lt;/said&gt;\\!&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\nThe encoder could have put the quotation marks outside of the said and soCalled elements, and the exclamation point could have been inside or outside of the p element.  Encouraging consistency aids interoperability.\r\n\r\n4\\. There is no element within &lt;editorialDecl&gt; for indicating whether other punctuation marks besides quotation marks were retained.  For those creating linguistic corpora using &lt;s&gt;, for example, this is relevant.  Perhaps create a &lt;punctuation&gt; for this purpose?  I'm not sure how that would relate to &lt;quotation&gt;, though.  In any case, if a new element is created, it should also be referenced from section 3.2.1.",

It suspect the Glines are correctly vague on this topic because there is considerable variation in practice. But you;re right to say we should make it easier to document explicitly what policies have been adopted.",

  "summary": "Encoding of Standoff annotations",
  "description": "The annotation of documents using standoff annotations is a very useful and flexible methodology. Nevertheless, TEI does not have any specific elements for encoding this information.\r\nIn most of cases, the standoff annotations are stored as external TEI files linked to the text being annotated. Nevertheless, this way of storing the standoff annotations is very rigid and presents numerous problems, for example, for indexing or searching the corpus of documents using the information of the annotations. In these cases, it would be very useful to have the standoff annotations INSIDE the TEI documents being annotated \\(\\!\\!\\!\\). \r\n\r\nTherefore, it is suggested to include define a new set of TEI elements specifically dedicated to the encoding of the standoff annotations.\r\n\r\nThe idea would be to store the standoff annotations between the &lt;teiHeader&gt; and the &lt;text&gt;, following the same philosophy as used for the &lt;facsimile&gt; and for &lt;sourceDoc&gt; \\(in some way these two elements could also be considered as a \"type\" of annotation\\).\r\n\r\nFor the standoff annotation, the structure could be:\r\n\r\n&lt;TEI&gt;\r\n&lt;teiHeader&gt;\r\n...\r\n&lt;/texHeader&gt;\r\n&lt;standoff&gt;\r\n\\[information of the annotations\\]\r\n&lt;/standoff&gt;\r\n&lt;text&gt;\r\n...\r\n&lt;/text&gt;\r\n&lt;/TEI&gt;\r\n\r\nThis structure would provide the extra advantage of allowing to annotate the information at different TEI levels in a natural manner. So for more complicated TEI documents having different hierarchical levels, the standoff annotations could be encoded as follows:\r\n\r\n&lt;teiCorpus&gt;\r\n&lt;teiHeader&gt;\r\n...\r\n&lt;/teiHeader&gt;\r\n&lt;TEI&gt;\r\n&lt;teiHeader&gt;\r\n...\r\n&lt;/texHeader&gt;\r\n&lt;standoff&gt;\r\n...\r\n&lt;/standoff&gt;\r\n&lt;text&gt;\r\n...\r\n&lt;/text&gt;\r\n&lt;/TEI&gt;\r\n&lt;TEI&gt;\r\n&lt;teiHeader&gt;\r\n...\r\n&lt;/texHeader&gt;\r\n&lt;standoff&gt;\r\n...\r\n&lt;/standoff&gt;\r\n&lt;text&gt;\r\n...\r\n&lt;/text&gt;\r\n&lt;/TEI&gt;\r\n&lt;/teiCorpus&gt;\r\n\r\nThis structure would also provide the extra advantage of allowing to annotate, not only the text of the document, but also the metadata of the different hierarchical levels of the TEI document.\r\n\r\nThe specific encoding of the annotations inside &lt;standoff&gt; could be as follows:\r\n\r\n&lt;standoff&gt;\r\n&lt;annotation type=\"...\" subtype=\"...\"&gt;\r\n&lt;author&gt;...&lt;/author&gt;\r\n&lt;date&gt;...&lt;/date&gt;\r\n&lt;ptr&gt;...&lt;/ptr&gt;\r\n\\[other data needed\\]\r\n&lt;/annotation&gt;\r\n&lt;/standoff&gt;\r\n\r\nAs a last remark it is also suggested to allow inside the &lt;annotation&gt; the TEI element &lt;figure&gt; in order to facilitate the annotation not only of textual information, but also of images and formulas.\r\n\r\nConclusion: the proposed structure for the encoding of standoff annotations in TEI provides the following advantages:\r\n\r\n\\- allows to encode standoff annotations under TEI in a natural manner, which is not the case at the moment\r\n\\- allows to store the standoff annotations INSIDE the TEI document being annotated in a specific location, facilitating the     process of indexing and    \r\nsearching said documents\r\n\\- it is naturally integrated in the hierarchical structure of the TEI \\(&lt;teiCorpus&gt;, &lt;TEI&gt;\\)\r\n\\- allows to annotate both, the textual and not textual information, and also the metadata of the &lt;teiHeader&gt;\r\n\\- facilitates the exchange of annotations because they are already stored in the original TEI document being annotated\r\n\r\nRemark: this idea has been already suggested by Piotr Ba\u0144ski in his article \"Why TEI stand-off annotation doesn't quite work and why you might want to use it nevertheless\", in http://www.balisage.net/Proceedings/vol5/html/Banski01/BalisageVol5-Banski01.html \r\n",

Now, when we consider the &lt;annotation&gt; this is another kind of \"object\" related to the text \\(like &lt;facsimile&gt; in some sense\\), and \\(in my opinion\\) it would be better to keep the metadata associated to each one separately. If we put the metadata in the &lt;header&gt; we will end up mixing different information \\(metadata\\) under the same structure, what can be very confusing. \r\nSince the metadata of the annotations is basically, author, date and a couple more of elements, I would be more in favour of keeping all encapsulated under the annotation.",

Part of the issue is that we are making different initial assumptions. In the article that Javier has quoted, my starting point \\(well, one of them\\) is simplifying the overall handling of annotation documents, by allowing &lt;teiHeader, standoff&gt; structures \\('&lt;&gt;' for an ordered pair, this time\\). I mentioned that, for full flexibility and parallelism, we could also allow for &lt;teiHeader, standoff, text&gt;.\r\n\r\nYour concern regarding the header is partly valid. I don't see the problem with a 'doubled' author information as forcing a solution whereby some formal metadata is squeezed below the header -- one solution could be: if there's a conflict, keep them separated and linked virtually, in a fully standoff manner \\(after all, standoff was a solution to, among others, information container overlap\\).\r\n\r\nThis is just a sample of the kind of discussion that we may have on this issue, and the possible compromises that we can come up with. Which is, as I said at the very beginning of this not, something that I see as a strong argument against implementing this fast and worrying later.\r\n\r\nI don't buy the argument that \"we need it NOW\". We have needed it NOW for the past, roughly counting, 17 years -- since the CES, if not before. Well, we will have it in a few days, in the LingSIG part of SF, open to experimentation and discussion.

There's no reason to abbreviate, because this is not an element that's going to crop up dozens of times in a document, and it's really not clear what `<stf>` might mean if you don't already know.\r\n\r\n2.

I agree, the main standoff annotations block should be called \"standoff\" (the document I released also agrees with this, see section 5). The elements \"stf\" and \"stfGrp\" are child of this main element for implementing the hierarchical standoff annotations and allowing the grouping of them. \r\n\r\n2. I am still not sure whether the metadata of the standoff annotations should appear in the teiHeader. In principle I like the idea of considering the standoff anotations as independent entities, so I would like to have the annotations as \"atomic\" as possible, i.e. self contained. In this approach also helps the fact of having \"fsdDecl\" as an element that can also be independent of teiHeader, so if further metadata about the annotations is needed (in the case of the feature structures) it can be defined outside teiHeader. In any case, I am still not 100% convince of this, so it could also be an idea to have part of the standoff metadata in the teiHeader (in the document this is also disclosed as an Open Issue, see section 8)\r\n",

  "description": "When encoding in TEI documents having a big amount of metadata, it is very often needed to group the metadata in groups, so the data can be organized in a easy and intuitive manner.\r\n\r\nThe TEI standards already offer some elements designed to group specific type of elements, for example:\r\n\r\n\\- &lt;group&gt;: contains the body of a composite text, grouping together a sequence of distinct texts.\r\n\\- &lt;castGroup&gt;\r\n\\- &lt;lg&gt; \\(line group\\)\r\n\\- &lt;surfaceGrp&gt; \r\n\\- &lt;altGrp&gt; \r\n\\- &lt;gramGrp&gt;\r\n\\- &lt;interpGrp&gt;\r\n\\- &lt;joinGrp&gt;\r\n\\- &lt;linkGrp&gt;\r\n\\- &lt;locusGrp&gt;\r\n\\- &lt;measureGrp&gt;\r\n\\- &lt;personGrp&gt;\r\n\\- &lt;rdgGrp&gt;\r\n\\- &lt;relationGrp&gt;\r\n\\- &lt;spanGrp&gt;\r\n\r\nNevertheless, these \"grouping elements\" are restricted to only one type of elements to be grouped and do not allow to mix different elements under the same group.\r\nFurthermore, the fact of having already so many different \"grouping elements\" directed to different specific elements shows the need of defining a generic mechanism to group the TEI elements.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it is proposed to create a TEI element \\(for example &lt;grp&gt;\\) that allows to logically group any set of TEI elements.\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n&lt;grp&gt;\r\n&lt;\"element1\"&gt;\r\n&lt;\"element2\"&gt;\r\n&lt;\"element3\"&gt;\r\n&lt;/grp&gt;\r\n\r\nFor example, one could need to group a set of organizations to which a certain document has some type of relationship.\r\nIn this case, it could be useful to group said set of organizations as a group in the metadata associated to the TEI document:\r\n\r\n&lt;grp type=\"organizations\"&gt;\r\n&lt;orgName&gt;...&lt;/orgName&gt;\r\n&lt;orgName&gt;...&lt;/orgName&gt;\r\n&lt;orgName&gt;...&lt;/orgName&gt;\r\n&lt;/grp&gt;\r\n\r\nThis element would be extremely useful when encoding in TEI documents comprising a big amount of metadata associated to them \\(elements in the &lt;teiHeader&gt;.",

        "text": "Hi,\r\nmany thanks for your reply. I will try to provide an example where it could be more clearly identified the need of the proposed &lt;grp&gt; element.\r\nThis element will be very useful for documents having a lot of metadata that must be encoded in the header of the document or other parts \\(like &lt;facsimile&gt; for example\\). This element would also prepare the TEI standards to encode not only the textual information of a document but also information stored in databases, stylesheets, etc... \r\nIn all these cases, it is needed to define a type of hierarchy between the different encoded elements.\r\n\r\nLets take the following example: \r\nCurrently TEI defines the element &lt;linkGrp&gt; \\(link group\\) that defines a collection of associations or hypertextual links.\r\n\r\n&lt;linkGrp type=\"translation\"&gt;\r\n&lt;link target=\"\\#CCS1 \\#SW1\"/&gt;\r\n&lt;link target=\"\\#CCS2 \\#SW2\"/&gt;\r\n&lt;link target=\"\\#CCS \\#SW\"/&gt;\r\n&lt;/linkGrp&gt;\r\n\r\nThe point is that, in specific cases, it is needed to define a collection of links and corresponding titles.\r\nIn such a case I would need to group NOT links together but  sets of &lt;link&gt;+&lt;title&gt; together:\r\n\r\n&lt;grp&gt;\r\n&lt;link/&gt;\r\n&lt;title&gt;...&lt;/title&gt;\r\n&lt;/grp&gt;\r\n&lt;grp&gt;\r\n&lt;link/&gt;\r\n&lt;title&gt;...&lt;/title&gt;\r\n&lt;/grp&gt;\r\n&lt;grp&gt;\r\n&lt;link/&gt;\r\n&lt;title&gt;...&lt;/title&gt;\r\n&lt;/grp&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso another example: I have a document and I would like to encode this document in TEI but I also would like to keep track of certain metadata associated to the document, for example classifications in different schemas associated to this document grouped by country.\r\nNormally, the classification of the document can be encoded as:\r\n\r\n&lt;textClass&gt;\r\n&lt;catRef target=\"\\#...\"/&gt;\r\n&lt;classCode scheme=\"http://www.udcc.org\"&gt;001.9&lt;/classCode&gt;\r\n&lt;keywords scheme=\"http://authorities.loc.gov\"&gt;\r\n&lt;list&gt;\r\n&lt;item&gt;End of the world&lt;/item&gt;\r\n&lt;item&gt;History - philosophy&lt;/item&gt;\r\n&lt;/list&gt;\r\n&lt;/keywords&gt;\r\n&lt;/textClass&gt;\r\n\r\nThe problem is that I cannot group the different classifications by, for example, country. Depending on the specific needs and the original encoding, this could be very useful. Having a &lt;grp&gt; element it would be very easy:\r\n\r\n&lt;grp type=\"us\\_classes\"&gt;\r\n&lt;textClass&gt;...&lt;/textClass&gt;\r\n&lt;textClass&gt;...&lt;/textClass&gt;\r\n&lt;textClass&gt;...&lt;/textClass&gt;\r\n&lt;/grp&gt;\r\n&lt;grp type=\"eu\\_classes\"&gt;\r\n&lt;textClass&gt;...&lt;/textClass&gt;\r\n&lt;textClass&gt;...&lt;/textClass&gt;\r\n&lt;/grp&gt;\r\n\r\nActually the solution would be to encode the country information in each &lt;textClass&gt; but then it would be very difficult to organize the metadata information in a hierarchical manner.\r\nThere are many other possible examples, as many as different specific needs of the encoding.\r\n\r\nWhat lies behind the &lt;grp&gt; request is to allow the use of TEI for organizing the metadata associated to a document according to the user's needs.",

Defining the element &lt;grp&gt; it would allow us to define ANY hierarchy for storing the metadata \\(\\!\\!\\) what would provide the TEI a very powerful tool for the future encoding of documents having a big amount of metadata.\r\n\r\nWithout an element like &lt;grp&gt; we are very constraint when defining the hierarchy of the metadata as we desire and this is VERY IMPORTANT for example when we want to store the metadata in an EFFICIENT MANNER to implement the SEARCHING of the documents \r\nFor example, citing again the same example, for increasing the searching speed in certain applications, it could be more efficient to store the metadata as:\r\n\r\n&lt;grp type=\"us\\_classes\"&gt;\r\n&lt;textClass&gt;...&lt;/textClass&gt;\r\n&lt;textClass&gt;...&lt;/textClass&gt;\r\n&lt;textClass&gt;...&lt;/textClass&gt;\r\n&lt;/grp&gt;\r\n&lt;grp type=\"eu\\_classes\"&gt;\r\n&lt;textClass&gt;...&lt;/textClass&gt;\r\n&lt;textClass&gt;...&lt;/textClass&gt;\r\n&lt;/grp&gt;\r\n\r\n...rather than using attributes type and subtype.\r\n\r\nThis is at the end the GREAT advantage of having &lt;grp&gt; element, it would ALLOW the developers to encode the metadata in the MOST EFFICIENT MANNER for processes like searching, without constraints.\r\n\r\nTEI is VERY POWERFUL for encoding text and more and more other non-textual objects, but in order to take full advantage of it, it is also needed that it allows to also FLEXIBLE encode data like stand-off annotations and other type of metadata associated to the text but not necessary related to the textual contains \\(e.g. organizational aspects, administrative information, document flow management...\\). For allowing this further step in TEI, I think an element like &lt;grp&gt; would be extremely useful.\r\n",

When I try to run teitorelaxng (the alternative to CLI roma), pointing it at the local source directory, the build fails; if I point it at guidelines-en.xml, it also fails; but when I point it at p5subset.xml it succeeds. So it seems that, using either CLI roma or teitorelaxng, you need to build a copy of p5subset.xml yourself before you can use a local source.\r\n\r\nShould it be the case that if you run teitorelaxng pointing at a local source directory, if p5subset.xml is not there, it should be generated? If so, the CLI roma should presumably do the same thing. \r\n\r\nI've written to Sebastian for some help with this.",

  "description": "Currently &lt;head&gt;, if present, must be the first child of a &lt;div\\*&gt;, a &lt;table&gt;, or a &lt;list&gt; but not of a &lt;figure&gt;.  This is inconsistent.  While some argue that TEI need not support encoding whose XML serialization corresponds to the order of text as it appears in the source document, we currently support this for &lt;figure&gt; but not the others, which needlessly complicates the life of those who wish to encode in the order that text appears on the page.\r\n\r\nHere's a straightforward example.  If a scholarly text contains \"figure 1\" which is actually a list or a table, for which the heading \"figure 1\" appears below the list or table, there is no way to encode the &lt;head&gt; after the &lt;list&gt; or &lt;table&gt; even though this is easier to render and easier to process, especially if \"figure 1\" crosses page boundaries.  While one could of course wrap the &lt;list&gt; or &lt;table&gt; in a &lt;figure&gt; element, which does allow &lt;head&gt; at the end, I believe this would be tab abuse committed against &lt;figure&gt;, which as explained in section 14.4 is meant for \"graphic images within a document\".\r\n\r\nThe case for doing this in div\\* as well is harder to make, but I imagine less conventional texts sometimes have headings that don't appear in the \"right\" place in the source document.",

When you delete something, though, you delete it; I don't think there's a way to warn people about this other than putting it in the change notes and the release announcement. I don't think it would be appropriate to put things in the Guidelines prose about attributes that used to exist.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nMartin",

Cots are the order of the day at every inn, and people arriving by late trains often go the rounds of all of them before they can get that accommodation well. The shoppers of the gentle sex swarm the downtown streets by daylight, and it seems as though even the vast warehouses must soon be emptied by the way the bundles are carried off.",

  "description": "The discussion of April 2012 regarding &lt;ptr&gt; included Lou's \"we will certainly consider these revisions\" and there were a few suggestions that the Guidelines might be too focused on how &lt;ptr&gt; is used in marking up the Guidelines themselves. \r\n\r\nBut the issue never made it into Sourceforge. So here it is.\r\n\r\nI stand by the position that Dan O'Donnell summarized better than I did: \"ptr should not be used when the textual stream depends on ptr being resolved to a particular representation \\(or at all\\).\" That is, if &lt;ptr&gt; is just a pointer, it should merely point. If the &lt;ptr&gt; can't be simply ignored without corrupting the textual stream, then \\(at least as currently documented\\) it should not be used. Maybe &lt;ref&gt; with a @cRef, or maybe some new element, maybe an &lt;include&gt; with a processing directive that could be project-specific such as \"everything\", \"title\", \"figureNo.\" -- but &lt;ptr&gt; isn't right, even if that's how the Guidelines are currently marked up.\r\n\r\n\\(By the way, I have seen &lt;ptr&gt; as a straight-up include instruction. It just pointed to external XML that was meant to be read in situ.\\)\r\n\r\nReally, I think &lt;ptr&gt; is now just a generic wrapper for @target. \"Oh, I need to point -- to signal a link, a hyperlink, an inclusion of a label, inclusion of a block of XML, whatever -- like @target does, but that's an attribute and I need an element, So I'll use &lt;ptr&gt;.\"\r\n\r\nIn the discussion thread, my suggested options appeared at http://listserv.brown.edu/archives/cgi-bin/wa?A2=TEI-L;yjB6%2Fw;201204020828240700.\r\n\r\n",

It can be represented in your encoded version in  a way which approximates more or less to the original source, just like a quotation. You might want to say \"it's a link and I don't care how it was represented in the original sjuce\" \\(use &lt;ptr&gt;\\); you might wan t to say \"It's a link, and I want to preserve how it appeared in the original source\" \\(use &lt;ref&gt;\\). In either case you might want to supply some way of indicating the target of the link \\(that;s whatr @target does\\).\r\n",

I don't know if there is a specific reason for not allowing it on &lt;p&gt; but it does seem inconsistent, as a paragraph can be fragmented just as well as a division or an anonymous paragraph-level block. \r\n\r\nThe specific use case behind my suggestion is one where the contents of individual pages \\(or other units normally represented by milestone elements\\) are extracted from a larger document for processing purposes and it would be important to indicate which of the paragraphs and other textual containers on the page have been broken up by the page \\(or other physical\\) boundary.\r\n\r\nIf there are no compelling reasons for limiting the @part attribute only to the elements for which it is currently available, I would also see it become available for all \"textual containers\" starting from the &lt;text&gt; element itself \\(i.e. &lt;front&gt;, &lt;body&gt;, &lt;back&gt; and the various special-purpose paragraph-level elements allowed in them\\). This would be very useful in language corpora which frequently include only extracts of whole texts, and the @part attribute could be used to indicate those textual components that have been sampled only in part.\r\n\r\nSince there do not seem to be current attribute classes that would cover the above mentioned elements, it might be worth it to consider either a new attribute class for all these \"textual containers\" or text-structural elements, or two new attribute classes \\(e.g. att.pLike and att.bodyLike\\) to supplement the existing att.segLike and att.divLike classes.",

In fact, I don't see how a line could be incomplete in either way without being incomplete in the other, so I suspect the use of \"metrical\" in its definition is pointless, and @part on &lt;l&gt; could be lumped in with the other @part in an attribute class.",

If you want to build a document against a fresh svn trunk rather than what teitoX uses by default, setting apphome to the root of the svn trunk won't be enough.

Fair enough.  \\(Although if there were an easy way to make teitodocx fail if the input file is not some sort of TEI document, that would be neat.\\)\r\n\r\nHowever, it accepted the extra arguments test2.xml and \\*.docx \\(there being no docx file in the directory, glob failed and the shell left this argument unchanged\\) but ignored them silently. Since there are no defined semantics to passing more than one source file and destination file to teitodocx and its siblings, it would be helpful if they failed before doing any processing when extra arguments are passed.",

  "description": "I initially raised this issue during the Council telco in December, and was tasked with asking for feedback on TEI-L. I've now done that, and I'm raising a ticket to summarize the responses. First, the problem:\r\n\r\nIf you go to the P5 Guidelines right now, you'll initially hit this page:\r\n\r\n&lt;http://www.tei-c.org/Guidelines/P5/&gt;\r\n\r\nfrom which you can navigate to the online version here:\r\n\r\n&lt;http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/index.html&gt;\r\n\r\nThis index.html page has links to all the prefatory material, some links \r\nto other related sites such as the SourceForge repository, and \"Some \r\nPopular Sections\", a list of a few chapters in the main Guidelines. It \r\nalso links to the full Table of Contents:\r\n\r\n&lt;http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/index-toc.html&gt;\r\n\r\nwhich is what it says it is.\r\n\r\nI've noticed in workshops that this three-stage entry process confuses \r\npeople, and in particular, the intermediate page with its \"popular \r\nsections\" is not very useful. Even more confusingly, if you click on the \r\nmain menu \"Guidelines / P5 Guidelines / -Table of Contents\", you go to a \r\ncompletely different page:\r\n\r\n&lt;http://www.tei-c.org/Guidelines/&gt;\r\n\r\nI received five responses, summarized here:\r\n\r\na\\) \\(2 votes\\): merge &lt;http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/index.html&gt; and &lt;http://www.tei-c.org/Guidelines/P5/&gt; into one single page \\(and leave the ToC as it is\\).\r\n\r\nb\\) \\(1 vote\\): merge &lt;http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/index.html&gt; with the ToC putting \"Versions of the Guidelines\", \"Some Popular \r\nSections\" and the language section on a separate column on the right.\r\n\r\nc\\) \\(1 vote\\): The extra index.html page is confusing, so get rid of it.\r\n\r\nComment from Lou:\r\n\r\nOne thing I like about the \"short\" index page is that it puts the language switches up top, so people realise the Guidelines are available \r\nin multiple languags. If we change things, I hope that will continue to be the case for whatever replaces it.\r\n\r\nNobody wrote to defend the multiple pages. I would go for b\\) myself, and b\\) also satisfies c\\). Many people say they just bookmark the ToC page once they've found it, and go directly there from their bookmark.",

  "summary": "teitoX: support passing configuration to saxon",
  "description": "I'd like sometimes to be able to have saxon do a trace when invoked as part of the teitoX tools. I do not currently see a way to do this. I read saxon's documentation but do not see there a way to cause the saxon instances launched by the teitoX tools to get parameters elsewhere than from the ant task launched by teitoX. In particular, I see no way to set an environment variable that would affect saxon's configuration. Saxon supports a configuration file \\(since version 9.4 in Saxon-HE\\) but I do not see in the saxon documentation any default file path for a configuration file. \\(But this is buggy, see below.\\) In other words, saxon will not read any configuration file unless told so explicitly.\r\n\r\n\\(Someone could probably hack something together by creating a custom jar and using --saxonjar, but yuck\\!\\)\r\n\r\nI've experimented with a modified version of teitodocx and a corresponding build-to.xml so as to have saxon read a configuration from a configuration file but I was not able to get it to work because of a bug reported here:\r\n\r\nhttps://saxonica.plan.io/issues/1676\r\n\r\nI still think that once the bug fix makes it through latest stable release, this will be the way to go.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, I've continued experimenting to obtain at least a trace. I'm attaching some patches to this feature request. This is not a complete solution because if no listener class is specified by the user, then http://saxon.sf.net/feature/traceListenerClass is set to an empty string, which saxon interprets as a class name, which it tries to load and then crashes. This is because if no listener class is specified then the factory net.sf.saxon.TransformerFactoryImpl should be instantiated without any attributes, rather than attributes set to empty strings. Certainly possible to get something nicer but I don't see how to do it without seriously refactoring build-to.xml. \\(But my ant-fu is very rusty so maybe there's a very simple solution I'm not seeing.\\) I'd rather not spend more effort on this given that, as I mentioned earlier, the ultimate solution will be to provide support to get saxon to read a configuration file.",

  "description": "TEI uses ISO 5218:2004 to assign sexuality of persons in a document \\( with attributes being given as 1 for male, 2 for female, 9 for non-applicable, and 0 for unknown\\). This is an outmoded and problematic representation of sexuality, and in particular formally assigns women to be secondary to men. \r\n\r\nThere are other discussions online regarding how best to tackle sexuality in markup, and the problems in using ISO 5218 - see the w3c lists here: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-contacts-coord/2010JulSep/0010.html . \r\n\r\nI would like to see TEI move away from enshrining women as the second sex in their markup - as Steven Ramsay tweeted:\r\n&lt;author&gt;Simone de Beauvoir&lt;/author&gt; &lt;sex value=\"2\"&gt;female&lt;/sex&gt; \\*sigh\\* \r\n\r\nCan a discussion be had about how best to achieve this?

Failing any other external standard to adopt, I suggest the datatype of @sex be changed from data.sex to enumerated, allowing project-specific definition of sex \\(with documentation\\). This would allow anyone who is currently using ISO 5218 validly to continue doing so, but anyone who wants to do better to definte their taxonomy in the teiHeader \\(perhaps a sexDesc element provided for the purpose?\\).",

When I've said that it is to point out how silly I find it to make the assumption that a numbering system of 1 and 2 somehow implies precedence or order \\(especially when '9' is also used\\).  IMHO, I don't think it truly 'assigns women to be secondary to men', just like if ISO 5218 was expanded to have , let's say, trans ppl as '3' that they would be considered tertiary and below women. I'm sorry that you find it offensive. I've always felt that It is just a different number. It is simply an agreed machine-processable label -- yes people can get offended by that, but that isn't inherent to the number itself but the interpretations people place on it.  I'm not saying those interpretations aren't real or don't have weight, validity or consequences.  But that has to be balanced against using some adhoc linguistically-specific system which is why we moved away from 'm', 'f', 'u', and 'x'.  There are many, many, other possible ways that people could record the information about sex and/or gender using TEI should they wish to do so on point of principle. \\(Using @ana to point to a full taxonomy of possibilities, for example.\\)  Or as Sebastian points out local implementations are free to change the values associated with data.sex if they wish. I've always felt unease at the limitation of the 4 values and would happily argue for updating it if an agreed standard could be formalised.\r\n\r\nI'm not saying the TEI shouldn't change this, but I would instead be trying to get ISO to redefine the standard in some appropriate way and then TEI would, happily and without argument,  implement that.  \r\n\r\nNo one has suggested what possible values we \\*should\\* use, so discussion would need to develop a clear proposal. Part of the problem is that any numerical system has the perception of ordering, and alphabetic ones have linguistic culture-specific assumptions that we'd prefer to shy away from if possible. One possibility suggested to me was to code for chromosome types XY for males and XX for females \\(which nicely gets a way to deal with sex chromosome abnormalities like Klinefelter syndrome\\), however, while this may work for biological sex identification it does not deal with gender and/or sexual identification such as the list proposed by Gabby. I honestly do not know what the right values should be.  If I was encoding texts where it was felt important to have more than the four categories, as I suggested I would probably use a &lt;taxonomy&gt; with a range of values suitable to the task.\r\n\r\n\\[Since Gabby has already done some research in this area, I'm assigning the ticket to him to make sure we don't lose sight of it.  Marking it as group 'RED' at the moment because we'd need a clear proposal to discuss and it isn't all clear what that proposal should be.\\] ",

It may well be, then, a very uphill task indeed to argue for a revision. \r\nMaybe the argument of offence caused would have an impact.

After discussion, Council agreed to have Lou adopt the uncontroversial parts and have the ad-hoc committee bring back further reconsidered revisions.  Lou did so, including a list of bulleted items that desribe differences in ontology.  The committee has been working on this piecemeal, focusing on first straightening out use of &lt;biblScope&gt;.  Now that that's done, I'm looking for things that we still haven't dealt with.\r\n\r\nThe proposal contained one more list item, which is commented out in the ODD source:\r\n\r\n&lt;\\!--item&gt;The components of the TEI file\r\ndescription do not prescribe that data be transcribed according to\r\nAACR2 rules.&lt;/item--&gt;&lt;\\!-- removed as already stated above--&gt;\r\n\r\nI do not feel that what I intended to say was adequately expressed above.  So I would like to add the following, now as the first bullet in the list:\r\n\r\n\u2022\tThe TEI Guidelines do not prescribe that text be transcribed from the chief source of information with normalized capitalization and punctuation as in a national cataloguing code.\r\n\r\nI feel that a user should understand that the TEI doesn't tell you how to transribe any bit of text from the source that you put in a particular element in the header.  So even if you used a TEI header to MARC crosswalk like the one found in the Best Practices for TEI in Libraries \\( http://purl.oclc.org/NET/teiinlibraries \\), or even if you use Thutmose II \\( http://wiki.tei-c.org/index.php/Thutmose \\), your resulting record won't look like other catalog records.",

It suggests that &lt;bibl&gt; is usually used when the content is less rigorously marked up; this is in contrast to what the Guidelines explicitly say above, where &lt;bibl&gt; is \\(as we argued\\) shown to be useful in situations such as born-digital documents where the order of elements is what is important, not the density of markup.\r\n\r\n2\\. It suggests that a &lt;listBibl&gt; that combines fully-marked-up &lt;biblStruct&gt;s with loosely-marked-up &lt;bibl&gt;s would be somehow worthwhile. It would actually be bad practice, because only parts of the information in it could be recovered mechanically in any useful detail. If, as the Guidelines already claim, \"the listBibl element is most appropriate for a more formal bibliography\", then we should not be providing an example \\(the first example of it, in fact\\) which is relatively useless for formal work.\r\n\r\nThis is also an opportunity to demonstrate, and explain in the subsequent paragraph, how full tagging can be done within &lt;bibl&gt;.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the subsequent example in the text is identical to the original with the exception that it is wrapped in a &lt;list&gt; instead of a &lt;listBibl&gt;, with the claim that this might be done when such elements are \u201cpresented informally\u201d. If we leave this subsequent example unchanged, it exemplifies the way that &lt;bibl&gt;s may have sparser markup, by contrast with this example.\r\n\r\nSo we would change this:\r\n\r\n&lt;bibl xml:id=\"NELSON88\"&gt;Ted Nelson: &lt;title&gt;Literary Machines&lt;/title&gt;\r\n\\(privately published, 1987\\)&lt;/bibl&gt;\r\n&lt;bibl xml:id=\"BAXTER88\"&gt;\r\n&lt;author&gt;Baxter, Glen&lt;/author&gt;\r\n&lt;title&gt;Glen Baxter His Life: the years of struggle&lt;/title&gt;\r\nLondon: Thames and Hudson, 1988.\r\n&lt;/bibl&gt;\r\n\r\nto this:\r\n\r\n&lt;bibl xml:id=\"NELSON88\"&gt;\r\n&lt;author&gt;\r\n&lt;persName&gt;\r\n&lt;forename&gt;Ted&lt;/forename&gt;\r\n&lt;surname&gt;Nelson&lt;/surname&gt;\r\n&lt;/persName&gt;\r\n&lt;/author&gt;: &lt;title level=\"u\"&gt;Literary Machines&lt;/title&gt;\r\n\\(privately published, &lt;date when=\"1987\"&gt;1987&lt;/date&gt;\\)&lt;/bibl&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;bibl xml:id=\"BAXTER88\"&gt;\r\n&lt;author&gt;\r\n&lt;persName&gt;\r\n&lt;surname&gt;Baxter&lt;/surname&gt;, &lt;forename&gt;Glen&lt;/forename&gt;\r\n&lt;/persName&gt;\r\n&lt;/author&gt;\r\n&lt;title level=\"m\"&gt;Glen Baxter His Life: the years of\r\nstruggle&lt;/title&gt; &lt;pubPlace&gt;London&lt;/pubPlace&gt;: &lt;publisher&gt;Thames and Hudson&lt;/publisher&gt;, &lt;date when=\"1988\"&gt;1988&lt;/date&gt;.\r\n&lt;/bibl&gt;\r\n\r\nand add the following explanation after the example:\r\n\r\n\"This example also demonstrates the way that bibliographical markup of authors, titles, dates etc. can be handled differently in &lt;biblStruct&gt;s and &lt;bibl&gt;s.

And it takes some things as implicit that must be explicit in other regex dialects. For example, XML Schema's regex presupposes what in other regex dialects would be a ^ at the beginning and a $ at the end.\r\n\r\nA helpful comparison chart is here: http://www.regular-expressions.info/refflavors.html\r\n\r\nThe lack of opening and closing anchors would probably be the most trouble-making difference.\r\n\r\nI suggest the current language be changed to:\r\n\r\n@matchPattern should use only common-denominator features widely available in regular expression processors.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, there is no spec for a common-denominator subset. If it's felt the TEI spec must cite some standard and preferably one in the XML family, cite XPath 2.0.

We say that @style contains (by default) CSS code, but we don't specify a CSS version, or a specific collection of CSS modules.

        "text": "As I said on the thread, it depends what kind of resource you are modelling. I don't think you really want relatedItem inside biblFull but inside one of the elements that biblFull contains. So if the relatedItem is really related to the source of the file, not this electronic file, then it goes inside sourceDesc/bibl.  The problem comes when you want to say that this current electronic file, not its source, is related to some other thing. I don't believe the TEI copes with that very well but adding relatedItem to biblFull I don't believe is the answer partly because this leaves fileDesc itself without such a mechanism and if creating such a mechanism then I think there should be a structured place for it which allows other sorts of non-bibliographic relations rather than just having it directly in fileDesc.\r\n\r\nThe options as I see them:\r\n\r\na\\) Add relatedItem\\* \\(or a class\\) to the content model of fileDesc and biblFull\r\n\r\nb\\) Create a new element X allowed in the content model of fileDesc and biblFull which is intended as a location to put many different types of relatedItem as well as pointers and references to other items such as graphics or non-bibliographic works which somehow 'relate' to this work.  \\(e.g. &lt;surrogates&gt; might also be usefully embedded in element X?\\)\r\n\r\nc\\)  Add any of these items which might go in the hypothesised element X directly into biblFull and fileDesc.\r\n\r\nd\\) Don't do anything\r\n\r\nOf these I'm most in favour of B as you might have guessed, but would want greater input from librarians like Kevin and Michelle to see if we were doing the right thing and how other standards model having a place to store relations to other works \\(bibliographic and non-bibliographic\\). \r\n\r\nI don't think we want to just allow fileDesc anywhere biblFull is currently allowed  because I think that just leads to greater entropy and confusion. The two elements are not identical btw. while biblFull enables you to embed a fileDesc \\(e.g. of a TEI work you are cateloguing\\) content it has additional attributes which fileDesc does not have. e.g.: att.declarable.attributes, att.sortable.attributes, att.docStatus.attributes.  fileDesc, only appearing in the teiHeader doesn't need to be 'declarable' or 'sortable'.  However, what this does make me consider is that I'd quite like att.docStatus.attributes \\(@status\\) added to fileDesc. :-\\)\r\n\r\n-James",

If \"its use is not confined to digital texts\" \\(I assume this means \"not confined to describing digital texts\"\\) in what circumstances would I use it rather than one of the alternatives? I had always assumed that we have it for the very specific use case where we want to describe a pre-existing digital resource that has a TEI header. That makes sense.

Unfortunately, there appears to be no explicit way to add participant information into a &lt;stage&gt; element. We experimented with using @who in &lt;move&gt;, but ultimately decided that this misrepresented the nature of many character behaviours. After a lot of experimentation, we settled on doing including character participation info using @corresp, but it is clearly not ideal. @who added to &lt;stage&gt;, analogous to who it operates in &lt;move&gt;, would solve the problem.",

We would like to enclose \"des ongles\" in &lt;q&gt; tags. If &lt;foreign&gt; can contain &lt;soCalled&gt; or &lt;mentioned&gt;, what is the case against being able to do so for &lt;q&gt;?\r\n\r\nWe find there to be a slippery slope between &lt;soCalled&gt; and &lt;mentioned&gt;, so we prefer to use a generic &lt;q&gt; for all quotes throughout the project. For example, in Hermia's line below, is \"little\" in quotes because it was mentioned by Helena, or because Hermia is so-called little?\r\n\u201cLittle\u201d again?

        "text": "There are two reasons why &lt;q> is not permitted within &lt;foreign>. Firstly &lt;q> is an \"inter\" level element, which can appear between paragraphs as well as within them. Allowing it within &lt;foreign> would therefor be quite a major change to its content  -- it would have to allow paragraphs and lists as well. Secondly, &lt;foreign>-ness is regarded as subsidiary to &lt;q>-ness. This is not so arbitrary as it sounds: it's quite likely that a `<q>` will contain both foreign and non foreign material, whereas the reverse seems less probable. Also, foreignness can most economically be indicated by an attribute.  \r\n\r\nI would tag the speech you quote as follows \r\n~~~~~~~~\r\n   `<p xml:lang=\"fr\">La main, <mentioned xml:lang=\"en\">de\r\n   hand</mentioned>. Les doigts, <mentioned xml:lang=\"en\">le  fingres</mentioned>.\r\nJe pense que je suis le bon \u00e9colier. J\u2019ai gagn\u00e9 deux\r\nmots d\u2019anglais vitement. Comment appelez-vous <mentioned rend=\"quoted\">les ongles</mentioned>?`\r\n~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\n[Tho this doesn't of course indicate that what is presented as \"French\" here wouldnt go down so well in the hexagon (\"vitement\", forsooth)]\r\n\r\nWhich brings us to the slippery slope of &lt;mentioned>. You're quite right in thus characterising it, but you're not required to make this subjective and perhaps over subtle decision. You can simply use &lt;q> for anything wrapped in quote marks -- effectively as a synonym for &lt;hi rend=\"quoted\"> if you like : many people do.\r\n\r\n ",

I\u2019ll like a maid\r\n> the better whilst I have a tooth in my head. Why,\r\n> he\u2019s able to lead her a *coranto*.\r\n\r\nAnd Parolles:\r\n> I would have that drum or another, or\r\n> *hic jacet*.\r\n\r\nHere we need a container, probably &lt;foreign&gt;.\r\n\r\nApplying tags consistently is one of our aims. In my mind, someone who wants to search for foreign words/phrases should not have to search in two places: foreign tags and xml:lang attributes. Now, if we can apply the xml:lang attribute to all &lt;foreign&gt; elements, we don't have this problem.\r\n\r\nBut, again from All's Well:\r\n> First Soldier: *Boskos thromuldo boskos.*\r\n\r\nand a few lines later:\r\n> FIRST SOLDIER *Boskos vauvado*, I understand thee and\r\n>  can speak thy tongue. *Kerelybonto*, sir, betake thee\r\n>  to thy faith, for seventeen poniards are at thy\r\n>  bosom.\r\n\r\nIn the first example, you have a foreign phrase that comprises the whole speech. According to LB, we should use xml:lang in the &lt;sp&gt; element. In the second example, we need to use the &lt;foreign&gt; tag. Why not use the &lt;foreign&gt; tag for both? Besides, this is a made-up foreign language. When the language cannot be identified, or when it is a corruption of a known language, how do we apply the xml:lang attribute?\r\n",

If we put our minds to it, we can perfectly well think of elements for which we cannot conceive of any need for @xml:id or @xml:lang, to take two examples. When would you need @xml:lang on `<pb/>`, for instance, or @xml:id on `<lb/>`?

To summarize, the following groups of elements have been suggested so far:\r\n\r\n1. Martin (supported by Laurent) suggested several dictionary elements, including: `seg, pron, def, phr, quote, cit, persName, placeName, name, hyph, m, gloss, fs`\r\n\r\n2. Scott Vanderbilt (supported by me, on behalf of several EpiDoc users) suggested several msDesc-related elements, such as: `support, supportDesc, objectType, material, history, origin, origDate, origPlace, provenance, dimensions, condition, handNote, decoNote, location, bibl`\r\n\r\n3. Jennifer Druin suggested `castList, stage`\r\n\r\n4. Laura Estil suggested `label`\r\n\r\n5. Thomas Carlson suggested `desc, note`\r\n\r\n6. Sylvia Stoyanova suggested `ref`\r\n\r\n7.

This ambiguity is potentially worse if @resp becomes global. However, we might recommend that a global @resp could point to respStmt elements instead of to individuals, thus removing all ambiguity about what it means; the same @resp could point to two respStmts in which different individuals or groups are assigned responsibility for different aspects of the element which bears it. A global @resp might be more acceptable in this scenario.\r\n\r\n The objection that making things global is in itself a bad thing was raised but strenuously opposed; there is nothing intrinsically bad about global attributes.\r\n\r\n If @resp were global under the scenario detailed above, there would be a strong argument for @source also being global, through membership of the same class.\r\n",

It would be good to be able to distinguish the two cases, since both are equally likely when recording stamps in general. If this element is used for postmarks or postage stamps, for example, you might well want to distinguish text actually forming part of the postmark or appearing on the postage stamp from a general description of the stamp. However, the content model says that its content is just macro.phraseSeq, which doesn't include `<desc>`, though it does include all sorts of other largely irrelevant nonsense.

One I think is just a boo-boo, so I'll\r\naddress it later. But the other boils down to the idea that this\r\nchange doesn't solve the problem, in the big picture.\r\n\r\nLou correctly points out the main problem -- that it's not entirely\r\nclear whether `<stamp>` is supposed to hold the transcription of a\r\nstamp, or a description of it. This (IMHO) is because\r\na) there is a strong desire on the part of many to transcribe what\r\n   has been stamped using `<stamp>`, and\r\nb) there is an example in 10.3.3 that shows it being used that way\r\ndespite the description of `<stamp>` clearly saying it \"contains a word\r\nor phrase describing a stamp\".\r\n\r\nI share Paul's instinct that this is very similar to a figure, where\r\none might want to describe it (  `<  figDesc  >`  ), give a facsimile of it\r\n(`<graphic>`), or transcription of (what is written in) it\r\n(`<floatingText>`) or some combination thereof.\r\n\r\nI'm guessing that we can confine transcriptions of stamps to within\r\nsomething a lot smaller than a `<floatingText>`. So my instinct is to\r\nhave something like\r\n  ( model.pLike | model.descLike | model.graphicLike )*\r\nas the content of `<stamp>`, with prose that discuss and examples that\r\nshow `<desc>` used to describe it, `<ab>` used to provide a\r\ntranscription, and `<graphic>` used to provide an image.\r\n\r\nThis would be problematic, of course, because it would potentially\r\ninvalidate lots of current uses of `<stamp>`, which often has text\r\ncontent.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of which, the boo-boo I referred to above is that the\r\nproposed content does not include text. Since it does include\r\nmodel.gLike we can surmise that this is just an oversight, though.\r\n",

To my mind a chapter is an incomplete object, whereas the definition (admittedly rather vague) of a `<text>` suggests that it is complete in itself. I don't know enough (or anything much!) about this material so I cannot judge how pertinent that distinction is to your work. However, as aforesaid, I see no problem in adding @type to `<group>`. ",

E.g. a collection of sermons is a text, each sermon is a div; but these are frequently published both separately and as a collection, and in the latter case the title pages, dedications, etc., of each sermon are preserved in the collected edition. What would be a div'd body must necessarily be tagged as a group of texts. But I think the request must relate to some other need, since in my example the superordinate text tag happily bears the @type attribute, with no need to type group, or body for that matter. I have no objection to adding @type to group, however, in the interest of the abstract structure text-group-text-div.",

The admin data (or a summary of it) is periodically merged into the MARC, and from the MARC a TEI header is derived. It would be nice to be able to carry all of the MARC info into the TEI; ideally, even to the point that we could create a lossless round trip. Aside from boilerplate (licensing restrictions and the like), there is nothing in the header that is not derived from the MARC, and we have begun moving even that back into MARC, so that header generation becomes a purely automatic process, and the manual work is all done in MARC.",

However, I am having trouble finding this stated explicitly in the Guidelines.\r\n\r\nThe introduction to section 2.3.4 (#HD57) implies that more detailed information might be elsewhere in the header, and section 2.3.4.2 (#HD57-2) does not mention any other location where you might put such information.\r\n\r\nI might also expect to find a mention of this use of an ODD in section 1.2 (#STIN) and section 23.3 (#MD).  I confess to not having time right now to re-read these sections closely, so I might have missed a reference.  But I would also expect this use to be stated somewhere obvious, near the beginning of these sections.",

It seems to me there are a few separate questions:\r\n\r\n1. Whether tagUsage should be used to describe only uses of elements, not uses of element-attribute combinations (as was said on TEI-L).\r\n\r\n2. Whether you have to include a tagUsage for every element in your document (as Syd understands from section 2.3.4) or whether you can use it for only those elements that you care to discuss (as Sebastian seemed to think was the case).\r\n\r\n3. Whether to redefine tagUsage so that it is used only for formal description, without any prose description.\r\n\r\n4. Whether to make more explicit that tagUsage is supposed to be used for usages specific to a particular document, not practice across a set of documents (which would go only in the ODD).\r\n\r\nI suggest that we think not about how to interpret the Guidelines as currently written but about what we think would be a good way going forward and then consider whether we can get there without breaking backwards compatibility.\r\n\r\nI have no particular opinions on any of these questions, so I'm open to your suggestions.\r\n\r\n--Kevin ",

  "description": "I'm slightly confused by the description and model of the `<geogFeat>` element. It is described as an element to tag the term for a geographical feature within a `<geogName>`. The latter element is often used in transcription, e.g. to tag a river named in the primary text, and its content model is therefore macro.phraseSeq, as such names may be abbreviated, damaged, corrected, regularized, contain words and other names, etc.\r\n\r\nIt would seem natural--and I have a colleague who would like--to be able to tag the term for the geaographical feature in the transcribed text as well, for example:\r\n\r\n`<geogName>\u1f21 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03a3\u03ba\u03b1\u03bc\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5 <geogFeat>\u03c0\u03b7\u03b3\u03ae</geogFeat></geogName>`\r\n\r\n(i.e. `The <geogFeat>source</geogFeat> of the (River) Skamander`)\r\n\r\nBut the content model of `<geogFeat>` is only macro.xtext (i.e. text and `<g>`), so if there is any editorial intervention or description inside this word, is cannot be tagged.\r\n\r\nIs this a corrigible error (that is, make `<geogFeat>`'s content match up with `<geogName>` etc.), or do people think that this element is *only* for use in the `<teiHeader>`, and should never be used in transcription? If the latter, then we should make this explicitly clear in the element spec, because currently users have no way to know they should not use this element in a tagged transcription of the primary text.",

But I agree that it would be better to make its content model consistent with other components of `<geogName`>. How do you feel about `<offset>`? Presumably the same argument should apply there?",

  "description": "Hugh Cayless wrote on tei-council on 2013-06-20:\r\n\r\n> It *is* possible to have an HTTP URI which is also an identifier, and in that case, I'd argue for keeping it in `<idno>`. I doubt there are any examples in the Guidelines, but it's the kind of thing we may see more of as Linked Data picks up steam. For example, the URI `http://papyri.info/biblio/8276/ref` denotes an actual book, and resolves to http://papyri.info/biblio/8276, which is a bibliographic record. Worldcat ids, like `http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/185922478` function in the same way, and I can easily see people wanting to use them inside `<bibl>`s.  I would. Maybe some thinking about the appropriate @type to use for these is warranted...\r\n\r\nI suggest that we add \"uri\" as a suggested value for idno@type and gloss this value as being used for URI used as an identifier for an item without intending resolution.  Giving one of these examples would be good.\r\n\r\nWhile I also suspect we haven't used `<idno>` this way in the Guidelines, I know that we have used @ref in this way in a few cases.

  "summary": "Add @source to att.responsibility",
  "description": "As discussed in a side-note to [FR 443](https://sourceforge.net/p/tei/feature-requests/443), I propose that the attribute `@source` be added to the `att.responsibility` class. This will allow the identification of a (e.g.) bibliographical source for an encoded statement anywhere that one can currently point to editorial responsibility for the encoding. We should then consider adding `egXML q quote writing` to this class, rather than definiting `att.source` separately, making the availibility of these two attributes more consistent.\r\n\r\nOne use case: apparatus criticus in documentary works often describe readings and emendations proposed in previous editions, rather than merely different manuscript witnesses or editorial responsibility for readings. It would be useful to encode this as something like:\r\n\r\n~~~~\r\n<app loc=\"4\">\r\n   <lem resp=\"#GB\">Diana<supplied>e</supplied></lem>\r\n   <rdg source=\"#gasperini1965\">Dianae</rdg>\r\n</app>\r\n~~~~",

Source means, \"This is the source of the current encoding\" (the emendation by an editor in a previous modern edition of this work, or other secondary discussion of this work); it's much closer to `@resp`, indicating the responsibility for the encoding, but pointing to a bibliographical reference rather than an element indicating the person of an editor.\r\n\r\nI would expect `<rdg wit=\"#gasperini1965\">Dianae</rdg>` to mean, \"the reading `Dianae` is found in another copy of this text, identified by that id\", which is a completely different matter. And because of the nature of the publication of inscriptions and papyri and other documentary texts, it's not possible safely to distinguish between a bibliographical reference that is \"secondary\", and one that refers to the \"primary\" text itself. (Gasperini 1965 might also be the canonical citation for some other inscription that witnesses to a variant reading.)\r\n\r\nIf I were going to tag this incorrectly (as I'm forced to in the absense of `@source`) I'd use `@resp`, certainly not `@wit`.",

In a more conventional example, it would be one of several manuscripts attesting to a single Platonic text. I certainly didn't mean \"a copy of this text\" in the sense that every modern edition is a copy of it--which wouldn't be `@wit` at all, in my view.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, the \"source\" for an emendation or other reading (for example of a difficult or damaged line) might be an editor's intervention in a modern edition of (or of one witness to) our historical text. This is not a witness to or variant of that text, but an edition of, even an interpretation of it. Emendations aren't indicated via sigla, conventionally, but via editor's names or references to the publication in which they appear; this convention is because these are two quite different kinds of information.\r\n\r\nI suspect that the _ad absurdam_ example you gave at the end of that comment might be nonsense... but the possibility of tagging two pieces of incompatible information is not an argument for not being able to tag *either of* those two pieces of information. But I suppose, if you think about it, you could imagine `<rdg wit=\"#x\" resp=\"#y\" source=\"#z\">` to mean:\r\n\r\n* `#x` points to an `msDesc` of a manuscript witness in which this reading is attested;\r\n* `#y` points to a `<person>` the editor (of this edition) who encoded this `<rdg>` element;\r\n* `#z` points to the bibliographical reference in which the reading given as `#x` above was interpreted and published thus.\r\n\r\nI don't imagine I would ever want to say all of this, but they're clearly saying different things.",

  "summary": "Deprecate @degree on precision",
  "description": "With the addition of att.ranging to &lt;precision> in release 2.5.0, this seems like a good time to reexamine the utility of the @degree attribute for precision. The need to express a lack of accuracy comes in to play in cases like dates, estimates of the number of missing characters in a text, and estimated measurements. Vagueness is often indicated in the text using a qualifier like *circa* or *about*. We can think of examples like the dates \"ca. 18 BCE\" or \"24 CE \u2013 ca. 38 CE\"; \"[ \u2013 c. 15 chars. \u2013 ]\" in a text indicating a gap of about 15 characters in width; \"6th century CE\", or even \"ca. 6th century CE\".\r\n\r\nIn some of these cases there is an unexpressed \"fudge factor\" being introduced by the use of *circa*. In the case of \"6th century CE\", the asserted accuracy is inherent in the date itself\u2014it's accurate at the level of the century, no lower.\r\n\r\nIf we want these kinds of estimates to be machine processable (so they can be picked up in searches, for example), the numbers, however vague, must be quantified. The members of att.ranging (@min/@max and @atLeast/@atMost) provide a straightforward way of quantifying the accuracy of an estimate in a way that @degree does not. @degree is defined as \"indicates the degree of precision to be assigned as a value between 0 (none) and 1 (optimally precise)\" and as such is only useful as a relative measure of precision (measured against other precision elements). Despite its being a number, it does not quantify accuracy at all, and therefore does the same job as @precision (which has the possible values \"high\" | \"medium\" | \"low\" | \"unknown\"). \r\n\r\nIn sum, having a numeric value to express the level of accuracy that can't be used to actually quantify the level of accuracy is a Bad Idea. It is misleading and confusing, even more so now that we have the tools to actually quantify accuracy. It is in use in the wild, so immediate removal is impossible, but it should be marked as deprecated, with a note explaining how to express accuracy using att.ranging (or alternatively simply to express a lack of confidence in the accuracy of a number using @precision).",

Working on https://sourceforge.net/p/tei/feature-requests/470/, I've come across something slightly related.\r\n\r\nThis FR points out that att.measurement provides for `<measure>` and `<measureGrp>` two attributes (@unit and @quantity) which are also provided by att.dimensions. Council therefore decided to do this:\r\n\r\n1. Move @commodity (the only other att in att.measurement) from att.measurement into a new class, att.commodity.\r\n\r\n2. Add measure and measureGrp to att.commodity.\r\n\r\n3. Add measure and measureGrp to att.dimensions.\r\n\r\n4. Override the definitions of @unit and @quantity on `<measure>` and `<measureGrp>` to supply suggested values that were originally part of their definitions in att.measurement.\r\n\r\nThis seemed to be a classic case of using the new capability of overriding class attributes at the element level to improve clarity and elegance. \r\n\r\nIf you think about it, though, by moving these attributes out of a class where they have a single valList and overriding them at the element level, we now need to define the same valList twice (once in `<measure>` and once in `<measureGrp>`) to get the same result. Now we have duplicated definitions and the consequent potential for inadvertent divergence.\r\n\r\nIn other words, we have more rather than less complexity. I think there are only two solutions to this:\r\n\r\n1. We keep the current situation.\r\n\r\n2. We consider the possibility of a mechanism that would enable us to add att.measurement to att.dimensions, so that att.measurement inherits @unit and @quantity from att.dimensions, but overrides the definitions of the attributes at that class level (in the process adding @commodity); `<measure>` and `<measureGrp>` remain members of att.dimensions and therefore inherit the modified attributes from there.\r\n\r\nThoughts? Could #2 work? Would it even perhaps work out of the box? (I'd be amazed if it didn't break DTD generation.)\r\n\r\nMy preference would be for #1 right now, with #2 as a long-term goal after we drop support for DTDs, as part of making the class system more of a true inheritance structure. I think it would be really useful to have the ability to define attributes with successive levels of specificity, with elements having the ability to select a particular version of an attribute from a particular class at any point in the tree. For that reason we could set the ticket to red to keep it around as a test case for such future developments in ODD.",

However,\r\n\r\n - your specific use-case, as outlined in the ticket, in which you're planning to use the elements to encode metadata about the authorship and date of specific parts of a document, is actually not an appropriate use of these elements. `<docDate>` and `<docAuthor>` are intended for the date and author of the entire document, not for subsets or parts of it.

The second is that @type if used in this way should be saying something about the type of description (e.g. its length or target audience) not about its subject matter. (Yes, this is the same argument as the one I lost about using @type on persName to specify a person's role rather than the kind of name it is). I've no objection to proposing a new attribute e.g. @scope or @role for desc if it is to be used as a generic something-we-dont-have-a-better-tag-for element, though the first problem remains. ",

Burying such information in a space-delimited attribute value make it hard to extract, e.g. with XPath.\r\n\r\nInstead, a child <ref> element or elements could be used to encode this information.",

  "description": "While the elements included in att.placement cover most of the things commonly occurring in margins or otherwise displaced from the normal textual flow, I wonder whether it would be completely inappropriate to also add &lt;head&gt; and the generic &lt;seg&gt; element to this class? Working with medieval recipe manuscripts, I frequently encounter recipe headings which are placed in the margin, as well as cases where the last few words of a recipe are placed in the margin (or some other place deviating from the general flow of the text) due to lack of space, and would like to be able to indicate this in a TEI-compliant way. \r\n\r\nI realize the &lt;label&gt; element is intended to be used for marginal headings, but it has the problem of not being allowed within the &lt;front&gt; of a text. My theoretical approach involves viewing recipe collections as discourse colonies and individual recipes as independent texts, and since the title of the recipe thus logically goes to the &lt;front&gt; (along with a possible recipe number and any reference markers), the &lt;label&gt; element (which, by the way, seems to be rather sparsely defined and documented at the moment) does not currently work.\r\n\r\nAs to the annotation of stray bits of text that have been shoved into all kinds of available spaces, this is by no means an uncommon practice in mediaeval manuscripts. While my annotation is intended primarily for use as linguistic corpus material and I thus really cannot adopt the purely visual encoding developed for genetic editing (as much as it does appeal to me), one of my central concerns is also the annotation of visual paratext, including layout. For this purpose I have developed a simple system based on the use of @place, @rendition and @rend; the only problem at the moment is that I have no TEI-sanctioned way of indicating the displacement of individual segments of text (and headings) from the textual stream, for which the most logical solution would be to allow @place on the &lt;seg&gt; element.",

  "summary": "Adding the @hand attribute to all (or most) text-containing elements",
  "description": "While the documentation of manucript hands in the header is currently well-supported, the assignment of these hands to individual stretches of text in the trasncription is much less so, as the @hand attribute is allowed only on a very limited number of elements, mostly limited to describing what could be called 'special cases' (att.transcriptional) or to specific editorial methods (att.textCritical). In addition, in the case of some of these elements, namely &lt;gap&gt; and &lt;damage&gt;, the @hand attribute does not really make sense in terms of the element itself but rather serves as a shorthand, implying the existence of an associated &lt;del&gt; element.\r\n\r\nIn order to be able to consistently indicate the hand responsible for every stretch of transcribed text, I would like to see the @hand attribute added (possibly via a new attribute class) to all text-containing elements on each level of the textual hierarchy. This would allow us to indicate the hands used in a document in a cascading fashion, indicating the principal scribe (if one exists) on the root &lt;text&gt; element and then indicating all deviations from this on the appropriate container element. This would mean that it would be trivial to determine the hand of any text node by simply finding the first ancestor that has the @hand attribute (and is not a &lt;del&gt; element*). \r\n\r\nWhile the ideal, most consistent solution would be to provide the attribute on not only &lt;text&gt;, &lt;div&gt;, &lt;p&gt;, and &lt;seg&gt;, but also on all of their more specialised parallels, its provision on these basic elements and the relatively common &lt;head&gt;, &lt;fw&gt; and &lt;note&gt; elements would most likely cover the major\u00edty of cases. This would allow the @hand attribute to be used properly for the purpose which it was intended according to the guidelines, which sadly is currently not possible. \r\n\r\nThe &lt;handShift/&gt; element is not really a solution, since many of the textual items written in different hands (but still as a part of the original production process, excluding them from additions) are things like headings, forme work (folio numbers, signatures, catchwords), and notes, which are not a part of the textual flow and would make it very awkward to shift back and forth using the milestone element. Additionally, it does not allow for the cascaded indication of hand and would add unnecessary milestone elements where none are actually needed.\r\n\r\n*) On the &lt;del&gt; element the attribute does not refer to the hand responsible for the textual content, but to the one responsible for the action indicated by the annotation, making &lt;del&gt; something of an anomaly; this could be seen as a reason for using a different attribute than @hand to indicate responsibility for a deletion. I would also very much like to see the @hand attribute removed from &lt;gap&gt; and &lt;damage&gt; elements in the favour of using a surrounding &lt;del&gt; element which not only is much more transparent semantically, but also allows the properties of the deletion and the ensuing damage or loss to be annotated separately.",

It seems plausible to reconsider this supposition, now that (for example) we have &lt;sourceDoc>. Making @hand global (or at least available on all elements which contain transcribed text) would be a fairly easy way to do this.

Doesn't that make it something like a specialized form of @rend? And if so, should it not apply to a great many elements indeed? Anything that can be written can be ascribed to a particular hand, just as anything that can be written can be written in a particular rendering.

My discussion with Laurent was chiefly about what needs to be done to the draft to move it along from a stylistic point of view, but also to call attention to parts of it which are not yet clear enough for Council to take a view on. \r\n\r\nI'll leave it to Lauren to answer Kevin's specific query above, but my take on it is that an entry in a lexical database is a very different kind of thing from an entry in a print dictionary, with different semantics and an entirely different internal structure, so there is good reason to propose a new element for it.",

In the TEI header, either of these is encoded using `<availability>`, which is inside `<publicationStmt>`.\r\n\r\nSince `<publicationStmt>` is akin to `<imprint>` just as `<editionStmt>` is akin to `<edition>`, I suggest that if we want to support use of `<availability>` inside `<monogr>`, it should be allowed only as a child of `<imprint>`, which contains information relating to \"[. . .] distribution of a bibliographic item\".  Just as bibliographies sometimes describe editions and sometimes copies, bibliographic items may be editions or copies.",

It's simply a grouping element for `<surface>` elements, used (for instance, from one of the Glines examples) to group all the leafs of a quire. None of our example show the use of dimensions on `<surfaceGrp>`. That said, it seems harmless for it to have those attributes, and perhaps someone wants to group surfaces (or surface groups) on a single plane, and specify their coordinates.",

  "description": "Mappings between TEI Header elements and Dublin Core fields have for the most part been stable and well identified for many years. There are however a few cases where we could helpfully provide more guidance, especially as the DCMI concepts are now clearly defined and standardised and even (I believe) mapped to eg DCR concepts.\r\n\r\nThis is a particularly striking example. We suggest for teiHeader/@type only two possible values \"text\" and \"corpus\". It would be more helpful to explicitly refer to http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-type-vocabulary/ which proposes and defines \"Collection\", \"Dataset\", \"Event\", etc. We should either simply reference this list from the spec or reproduce it as a suggested vallist.",

In implementing [FR 465](feature-requests:#465) I was originally going to add @source to att.responsibility and remove att.source. But there are elements that use att.source (like egXML) for which @cert makes no sense at all. In the end I made att.responsibility a member of att.source, but I think it would be better to divorce @cert from @resp and perhaps still combine @source and @resp into one class. I can see @resp being useful anywhere @source is (with the possible exceptions of q and quote) but @cert is only going to apply to things which are (on some level) guesses. Arguments against? For?",

Merged by MDH 2014-07-30.]\r\n\r\nFIRST:\r\n\r\nThe content model for `<app>` allows `<wit>` inside it to permit the encoding of sigla in a print apparatus. This corresponds to the machine-actionable references to witnesses using `@wit`. The next release of the Guidelines will allow `@source` on `<rdg>` (see [feature-requests:#465]), so it seems reasonable also to permit `<bibl>` inside `<app>` to allow bibliographic citations of sources in apparatus to be encoded properly.\r\n\r\nFor example in the following bit of apparatus:\r\n\r\n**9** latebit *FTX*\t\t**11** gelidas\u2026oras *Eutyches, G. L. K. v.* 475\r\n**12** suo *BP Eutyches*\t**14** n. n.] verba canina (carina *Zamoscianus*)\r\n*FTX cod. Zamoscianus* **etc.**\r\n\r\n\"*G. L. K. v.* 475\" cites page 475 of [Keil's Grammatici Latini](https://archive.org/stream/grammaticilatini05keil#page/474/mode/2up), so it would be reasonable to put it in a `<bibl>`, something like:\r\n\r\n~~~~~\r\n\r\n<app><ref target=\"#l11\">11</ref> <rdg source=\"#GLK\">gelidas...oras</rdg> \r\n<wit>Eutyches, </wit><bibl>G.

James, since you're the owner of both tickets, do you agree?\r\n\r\nSecond: there was a useful discussion of this ticket at the FTF in Oxford in July 2014, in which one issue that arose was this:\r\n\r\nSome believe that `<app>` and friends should only be used to encode new (i.e. born-digital) critical apparatus, while others believe it should also be appropriate to use `<app>` to encode both new apparatus and to encode a transcription of an existing print critical edition. The Guidelines chapter example based on Klaeber's Beowulf edition would seem unequivocally to support the latter view (http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/TC.html#TCAPLR). I think a final decision on this is essential before moving forward with these tickets; the need for the requested elements arises out of the encoding of an existing print apparatus.\r\n\r\nIf we do believe that `<app>` should do both jobs, then we will most likely face a slow accumulation of feature requests for more elements that need to be included in its content model. For this reason, the Council discussion gave rise to a proposal that we create model.appPart, and rationalize the content model of `<app>` to use that rather than the quite complicated and confusing content model it currently has. This will not be simple, because of the need to maintain backward compatibility.",

It is exactly analogous to &lt;moduleRef which means \"all the objects declared by this module\" but which can be tweaked to mean \"all bar some\" or \"only  these\". In neither case is anything actually being modified: it's just a subsetting operation. When you include the linking module, via a moduleRef, you get the full version of the att.global.linking class. Adding a classRef to the same class, to say you actually only want @corresp,  seems a perfectly comprehensible short cut, which ought to have the same effect as deleting the unwanted attributes, Why do you think the syntax makes no sense? what else could it possibly mean?\r\n  \r\n",

I can see how using classRef/@key='model.X' in content models with @include or @exclude could be a powerful mechanism to easily remove things from a content model.

Consider this:\r\n\r\n~~~~~\r\n  <category xml:id=\"dtPaperSize\">\r\n    <catDesc>The size of paper on which a manuscript document is written.</catDesc>\r\n    <category xml:id=\"dtA4\">\r\n      <catDesc>A4 paper</catDesc>\r\n    </category>\r\n    <category xml:id=\"dtA5\">\r\n      <catDesc>A5 paper</catDesc>\r\n    </category>\r\n  </category>\r\n~~~~~\r\n\r\nAny document may belong to either of the child categories (even both, if it happens to include both paper sizes); so we would see e.g. `<catRef target=\"#dtA4\"/>`, meaning that the document falls into the category of documents which consist wholly or partially of A4 paper. However, this does not make any claim as to the parent category; it makes no sense to say that a letter \"is\" or \"has\" a paper size, without specifying what that size is.\r\n\r\nIn other words, the \"category\" of paper size is not a category at all; it's a taxonomy. This issue comes up frequently in complex, nested taxonomies. It would be valuable to be able to create a structure like this:\r\n\r\n~~~~~\r\n<category xml:id=\"dtManuscript\">\r\n  <catDesc>Handwritten manuscript</catDesc>\r\n  <category xml:id=\"dtLetter\">\r\n    <catDesc>Handwritten letter</catDesc>\r\n  </category>\r\n  <category xml:id=\"dtMemo\">\r\n    <catDesc>Handwritten memo</catDesc>\r\n  </category>\r\n  <taxonomy xml:id=\"dtPaperSize\">\r\n    <desc>The size of paper on which a manuscript document is written.</desc>\r\n    <category xml:id=\"dtA4\">\r\n      <catDesc>A4 paper</catDesc>\r\n    </category>\r\n    <category xml:id=\"dtA5\">\r\n      <catDesc>A5 paper</catDesc>\r\n    </category>\r\n  </taxonomy>\r\n</category>\r\n~~~~~\r\n\r\nI submit that `<taxonomy>` should be available as a child of `<category>`, to allow for such rich multi-layered taxonomies.",

  "description": "Feature request\r\n\r\nSummary or proposal: Add a &lt;persona&gt; element as a child of &lt;person&gt;, with the same content model as &lt;person&gt;.\r\n\r\nThe problem: A TEI &lt;person&gt; may appear in disguise, a situation that is currently difficult to express in a TEI personography.  \r\n\r\nHere are two distinct cases, the second of which is naturally modeled with the proposed &lt;persona&gt; child of &lt;person&gt;:\r\n\r\nCase 1) Daniel Day Lewis is disguised as Abraham Lincoln. Both Lewis and Lincoln are persons &lt;person&gt;, with distinct DNA. \r\n\r\nCase 2) Barry Humphreys is disguised as Dame Edna Everage. Not the same as Lewis and Lincoln because there are not two persons, with distinct DNA. Projecting from the real to the fictional, the same is true of Jeckyll and Hyde (that is, in their fictional world they have the same DNA).\r\n\r\nThe focus of this proposal is on Case 2, where the relationship is not between two human beings, but between two personae assumed by a single (real or fictional) human being. This proposal makes no recommendation about encoding Case 1.\r\n\r\nA natural representation of Case 2 would involve permitting a new element, &lt;persona&gt;, as a child of &lt;person&gt;. &lt;persona&gt; would have the same content model as &lt;person&gt;. The XML parent/child relationship is a natural way to express that a single human being may operate in multiple guises, perhaps with some inherited information, but potentially with completely different (assumed or natural) names, traits, and statuses.\r\n\r\nTo use @sameAs to link two &lt;person&gt; elements in Case 2 would elevate an identity (or persona) to the status of person. As the Chair of the Personography Working Group wrote on TEI-L, 2014-02-20: \"someone disguising him- or herself as someone else does not become a different physical person -- certainly not in the way we intended the &lt;person&gt; element to be used, to 'provide information about an identifiable individual'.\"\r\n\r\nThe proposal is intended to address the Case 2 situation described above. Discussion of the proposal should not be distracted by Case 1, or by edge cases, such as triune divine hypostases; it is not intended to address those situations. It should also not be distracted by the distinction between real and fictional persons. Finally nothing in this proposal would prohibit a project from deciding that, in local use, Humphreys and Everage and Jeckyll and Hyde are all different persons, and therefore different &lt;person&gt; elements, and that the relationship among them should be expressed using @sameAs or &lt;relation&gt;. What the proposal would do is permit someone who views Humphreys and Everage as different personae of the same person (likewise for Jeckyll and Hyde) to encode them in a way that captures the fact that at the most fundamental level they are the same identifiable individual.",

  "description": "The fact that sourceDesc is mandatory within the header, even when there is no source because the header is describing a born digital object, has long been one of those charming eccentricities we have learned to cope with. However, the fact that the compulsory comment \"there is no source\" has to be supplied either within a &lt;p> or an &lt;ab> is annoying, since those elements are often used for other purposes within a document. I would like to change the content model of sourceDesc from its current value (effectively, one or more model.biblLike or model.pLike) to include as a third option one or more model.noteLike, so that the compulsory comment could be given within a &lt;note>. One possible alternative might be to permit an empty sourceDesc with the specific meaning of \"no source\" but that seems a bit too radical and would probably confuse many existing processes.\r\n",

You want to ensure that all the text in your corpus is properly segmented and that there is no stray text floating around outside the &lt;s> elements, which are also grouped into &lt;p> elements.

Neither the referent nor the target of a relation are \"active\" or \"passive\" in any of the senses of those words. Whenever I try to present this mechanism to students of TEI or EpiDoc, the confusion caused by the attribute names is effectively a deal-breaker for them. Some give up altogether. Others I am able to persuade to close their eyes and pretend something more intelligent is in there. As Piotr says, almost anything would be better than this.\r\n\r\nA grammatical metaphor such as `@subject/@object` would be clearer; a graph notation such as `@from/@to` would work fine (but see below); logical terms such as referent and referee would be clunky, but at least less wrong than active/passive. I could imagine `@target` making some sense, but a mirror element from that would be needed (`@match`?).\r\n\r\nHowever, sadly the `<relation>` element already takes `@from` and `@to` from att.dating, and would mean, \"This relationship applied between date-x and date-y\", so some other suggestion needs to be found. Maybe `@relationFrom` and `@relationTo`, or similar?",

And `<label>` is also used elsewhere, as a literal rather than URI.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it would be a good idea to try to model a new element close to Turtle syntax, calling it, as suggested above, `<triple>`, and using subject/predicate/object as the attributes, with the appropriate properties.

In this case, the existing composite manuscript is being encoded.\r\n\t\u2022\tmsPart (manuscript part) contains information about one part of a larger original manuscript whose distinct parts may reside in different repositories or contain different call numbers.  In this case, the original manuscript is being encoded with msPart used to provide information about the dispersed parts, or one distinct part is being encoded.\r\n\r\n(Examples of the first case are a portmanteau type manuscript or collection of manuscript pages that have been bound together as a composite in one library or museum.  msPart documents the different parts within this composite.  Examples of the second case might be: a manuscript or codex composed previously as a unified object whose pages now reside in different libraries/museums or in different bound volumes or under different catalogue numbers in the same repository; an inscription on a stone in which part of the text-bearing object remains in situ and another part has been relocated to a museum.)\r\n\r\nPlease also see the discussion on the EpiDoc Markup list (under the \"multiple repository\" subject line, for example here http://lsv.uky.edu/scripts/wa.exe?A2=ind1403&L=MARKUP&P=R2591&D=1&I=-3&O=D). \r\n\r\nAn example of a project already using msPart to describe one part of what used to be a larger original manuscript is Coptic Scriptorium (see the TEI files at http://coptic.pacific.edu).",

  "description": "At the Oxford 2013 face-to-face meeting, it was agreed that KH, SB, and LB would articulate a generic policy for the TEI on the integration of external standards.  (See note at https://sourceforge.net/p/tei/feature-requests/482/#28f3 .)  KH SB and LB emailed them:\r\n\r\n> Date: Thu, 26 Dec 2013 15:20:17 -0500\r\n> Subject: draft generic policy for TEI on the integration of external standards\r\n> \r\n> Gentlemen,\r\n> \r\n> In Oxford we were charged with drafting a one-page statement of policy \r\n> regarding integration of external standards into the TEI (see discussion \r\n> of FR 482).  We are supposed to have this done before the next \r\n> teleconference, which I believe will take place in January.\r\n> \r\n> I've tried not to reference how we've done things in the past (for \r\n> example, co-maintenance of feature structures) because it sounds like we \r\n> realize that we don't want to do things like this in the future.  In \r\n> fact, Council may decide it wants to clean up past practice once we \r\n> decide what we're doing in the future.  For now, though, a brief \r\n> statement of what we'd like to do in the future:\r\n> \r\n> http://www.tei-c.org/Activities/Council/Working/tcw28.xml\r\n> \r\n> Thoughts?\r\n> \r\n> Kevin\r\n\r\nI intentionally did not link it from http://www.tei-c.org/Activities/Council/Working/ since it hasn't been adopted by Council yet.\r\n\r\nI'm creating this ticket so we don't forget about this.\r\n\r\nIt now occurs to me that tcw28 should also address whether to link to an RFC or a BCP if both exist for the same thing.  I believe that if a document is revised, it gets a new RFC number, whereas the BCP number stays the same.  So the BCP is good as a stable point of reference, but it could change without the TEI Council (or users) knowing about it, causing a discrepancy between what's in the BCP document and how users or the Guidelines examples use something.",

The Corpus Coranicum is working on a documentation of the quran text and we want to use the standards provided by the TEI.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Quran has an occurrence which is \u2013 as far as I know \u2013 not covered by the TEI Guidelines, namely the divider between verses or \u201cVerstrenner\u201d, Unicode: 06DD, ARABIC END OF AYAH\r\nIt is a special characteristic of the quranic text and is used throughout quranic codeces and manuscripts citing the Quran. As the name suggests, it divides the verses of the Quran and displays the verses number in it.\r\n\r\nSince there is no such element designated, we thought about using the &lt;lb>- or &lt;w>-element, but that would be a makeshift solution, which doesn't really do justice to the subject. While &lt;lb> is usually used as a empty element for describing the meta-structure of a text, this end-of-ayah-sign is a part of the original text of the manuscript and thus needs to be transcribed as a part of the text itself. As any other \u201cword\u201d in a manuscript the markup of changes like correction, addition, deletion etc. and descriptive attributes like hand, numbering system [there are some different numbering systems of the quran] are required.\r\nThus we thought about using the &lt;w>-element, but we hesitate to use this as the TEI declares this element as \u201ca grammatical (not necessarily orthographic) word\u201c. And the end-of-ayah-sign is neither: it is kind of a structural markup written by the scribe itself and not necessarily used in a consistent way throughout the manuscript, nor across different manuscripts.\r\n\r\nTherefore we would be glad if the TEI Guidelines would supply an element especially for this occurrence or if you could point us to a well-thought and coherent solution. Plese note that the attached example contains hypothetical annotation in the lines 1-3 of this special charakter, which is to seen on the scanned image as a pile of four or more dots.\r\n\r\nWith best regards\r\n\r\nTobias J.

  "summary": "@selector attribute for the `<rendition>` element",
  "description": "The combination of `<rendition>` and @rendition currently allows us to link specific elements with blocks of style code (almost always CSS) in the manner of the HTML @class attribute, and @style allows the direct application of CSS to a specific element. What we cannot currently do is specify a default rendition for an element or a set of elements, except through the use of `<tagUsage>`/@render; this is crude in allowing only the linking of style blocks with unqualified elements, and it also brings in the requirement that every element used be provided with a matching `<tagUsage>` element.\r\n\r\nI would argue that a better approach would be a new attribute called @selector available on the `<rendition>` element, through the att.styleDef class. Its definition would be:\r\n\r\n*A selector or series of selectors specifying the elements to which the contained style description applies, expressed in the language specified in the @scheme attribute.*\r\n\r\nThis would allow simple definitions like the following:\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\n<rendition \r\n   scheme=\"css\" \r\n   selector=\"text front back body div p ab\">\r\n      display: block;\r\n</rendition>\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\nmaking this a straighforward way in which to express a basic mapping between TEI elements and their default styles. It would of course allow much more sophisticated mapping, including for instance the use of @rend:\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\n<rendition \r\n   scheme=\"css\" \r\n   selector=\"*[rend*=italic]\">\r\n      font-style: italic;\r\n</rendition>\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\nand would make it easy to express different default rules for the same element in different contexts:\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\n<rendition \r\n   scheme=\"css\" \r\n   selector=\"front p, back p\">\r\n      margin-top: 0.5em;\r\n</rendition>\r\n\r\n<rendition \r\n   scheme=\"css\" \r\n   selector=\"body p\">\r\n      margin-top: 0;\r\n</rendition>\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\nThis could be made even more powerful and sophisticated by the addition of a second attribute, @selectorScheme, which would allow the use of another selector language such as XPath in place of the one specified in @scheme:\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\n<rendition \r\n   scheme=\"css\" \r\n   selectorScheme=\"xpath\" \r\n   selector=\"p[string-length(.) gt 30][preceding-sibling::p]\">\r\n      text-indent: 0.5em;\r\n</rendition>\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\nIn this case, the definition would be amended to say:\r\n\r\n*A selector or series of selectors specifying the elements to which the contained style description applies, expressed in the language specified in the @selectorScheme attribute, or, where this attribute is missing, in the language specified in the @scheme attribute.*\r\n\r\nImplementation of this feature request (in both variants, with or without #selectorScheme) would obviate the need for the existing @scope attribute, since its functionality is available as part of CSS selectors, and of the `<tagUsage>`/@render attribute, but it would provide a simpler and better way of doing what these attributes currently partially and inadequately do.\r\n",

  "description": "This arises out of a Council list discussion which followed an attempt to implement [feature-requests:#460] by overriding the att.global definition of @rend in the `<elementSpec>` for `<list>`. This caused problems with DTD generation, and a simpler approach was used, but Lou suggested in the discussion that these three attributes form a natural class.\r\n\r\nI think there is a good case for this. Where one is used, the others are also likely to be used (especially with @rend and @rendition); and conversely, a simple born-digital document might not have any need for any of them.

If you use it for a standard referencing system, the implication presumably is that what goes in @n *doesn't* appear in the text. The note explains how it is \"typically\" used, but doesn't proscribe its use for anything else. I've used it for very short labels on `<category>` elements myself -- I have a long catDesc, a shorter gloss, and a very short @n that I can display in certain contexts where space is very tight.

So while I support the idea of defining att.styling, I don't think @n belongs in it.

        "text": "I\u2019m afraid your request is a bit lacking on details, fxparlant.\r\n\r\nIf you are following the Guidelines\u2019 recommendation and using @corresp to indicate translation, then it is not so difficult to find the \u201ctranlated from\u201d language of an element. Just follow its @corresp, and grab the language of the element you get to. (E.g., `//*[@xml:id = substring(current()/@corresp,2)]/ancestor-or-self::*[@xml:lang][1]/@xml:lang` \u2014 untested.)\r\n\r\nThat said, the TEI Guidelines do not give explicit advice on how to differentiate \u201cI am a translation (follow my @corresp to see of what)\u201d from \u201cI am translated (follow my @corresp to see to what)\u201d. Sometimes, perhaps often, that is not significant, or cannot be ascertained. But sometimes it is important and it has always bothered me that the TEI does not give guidance on this issue.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the TEI Guidelines do not provide a mechanism to differentiate translation from other uses of @corresp.\r\n\r\nSo I have long been a fan of a new semi-global attribute, @transOf, which would point to the textual structure of which the current element is a translation. I.e., it would be a directional, specially typed @corresp.\r\n\r\nThis would not solve the case, though, of wanting to indicate the language of some source that has been translated, when that source is not also being transcribed and encoded. E.g., how to indicate that\r\n\r\n~~~~~\r\n  <p>Aqu\u00ed el hombre complet\u00f3 sus primeras exploraciones de la luna.\r\n  Diciembre de 1972, A.D. Que el esp\u00edritu de la paz en la que nos\r\n  encontramos se refleja en la vida de toda la humanidad.</p>\r\n~~~~~\r\n\r\nis a translation (of the Apollo 17 plaque) from English into Spanish. (Again, it's easy if you have an English transcription of the source:\r\n\r\n~~~~~\r\n  <p xml:id=\"A17P\" xml:lang=\"en\">Here man completed his first\r\n    <lb/>explorations of the moon<reg>.</reg>\r\n    <lb/><date when=\"1972-12-14T22:55:00Z\">December 1972, A.D.</date>\r\n    <lb/>May the spirit of peace in which we came\r\n    <lb/>be reflected in the lives of all mankind<reg>.</reg></p>\r\n~~~~~\r\n\r\nall you have to do is say \u201cxml:lang=\"es\" corresp=\"#A17P\"\u201d, or, if my suggestion were to be used, \u201cxml:lang=\"es\" transOf=\"#A17P\"\u201d.) Of course you can always add a `<note>` to explain, but I would like something more formal and thus processable.\r\n\r\nI do not know which case the original poster (Fxp33) has in mind.\r\n\r\nP.S. I have just discovered that when using 5 tildes in a row to indicate to Se\u00f1ior Sourceforge that \u201cthis is a code block\u201d you have to have a blank line, too.",

I can imagine a situation in which Roma gets broken (or we're working on an update), and we need to run a separate Roma on a different server, but don't want or need the hassle of setting up a separate eXist when we can use the one that's already there. We probably do want to be able to control who can access it, but restricting it to localhost only might be too severe.",

  "description": "We already have a method for deprecating features we will be removing from the Guidelines (or at least, several strategies for doing so), which are designed to warn people long in advance that something may disappear or change. We need something similar for new features which are viewed as experimental, but which we want to introduce into a release of the Guidelines so that users can see them, try them and provide feedback, with the understanding that they are not yet stable.\r\n\r\nThere are two possible approaches to this: one is to fork the Guidelines and have a \"beta build\" in which new features are available which don't appear in the stable release. This may entail a lot of work in that changes to the main trunk will have to be carefully merged into the beta build regularly, so that the only differences between them are the experimental features; it also means that users would have to purposely go and find the beta build and use it before we could get feedback.\r\n\r\nA simpler approach is a simple method for marking a component of the specification as \"beta\". Right now, on e.g. `<elementSpec>`, we have att.deprecated's @validUntil. We could:\r\n\r\n* Change the name of att.deprecated to e.g. att.developmentStatus\r\n* Add a new attribute (@releaseStatus?) with values of \"alpha\", \"beta\", \"rc\" and \"stable\" (the default).\r\n* Update Guidelines processing to provide some helpful warning text for any element or attribute that carries a status which is not \"stable\".\r\n\r\nHaving this kind of feature would really help as Pure ODD is developed and integrated into the Guidelines over the next couple of years.\r\n",

There's a subcategory of interpolated text that covers text the editor believes was written by the author, but which doesn't belong where it's currently located. If the editor can locate the original place, then a combination of `<surplus>` and `<supplied>` or something similar can be used to relocate the text. But there's a final, missing subcategory, and that is text which the editor thinks is genuine, but which should be relocated they know not where. In editions, this kind of text is usually bracketed and marked by a note in the apparatus.\r\n\r\nI'm proposing a new element `<secl>` (for 'secluded') to cover this type of text, with a content model like `<supplied>`, for marking text which is genuine, but unable to be correctly placed.",

        "text": "Hi Hugh. I've thought about this for a few minutes and keep coming back to one initial problem: namely why isn't this just an 'add' element? The only thing that distinguishes it is that you don't know where to put it. But you have to put the 'secl' element somewhere in any case.  Usually one puts an 'add' element where you think it is anchored, and then with @place record where it was physically on the page. With 'secl' you'll still need to place it _somewhere_ in the XML hierarchy and I'm concerned that if you don't know where this goes that you'll have to put it _somewhere_ and still record where it was on the physical page.  So if we have a nice long 'p' element instead of putting an 'add' part way through to indicate it refers to this location, we might put it at the end and record through an attribute that it is not specifically anchored. We'd still record where on the page it appeared. It seems to me this is a structurally-unanchored 'add' element but not necessarily a semantically different category. It is the modern editor having a problem placing it, and this should be recorded, but to me doesn't really change the nature of the original addition.

        "text": "Thanks for your thoughts, James. In my mind, 'add' marks an insertion, i.e. text in a particular document that you can see someone has added after the original words were written. It\u2019s the counterpart to 'del'. so that doesn\u2019t quite work. Secluded text might be left where it appears in the witnesses, or it might be relocated to the end of the poem or book (depending on the type of work) or even to an appendix. This is something that might appear in a 'rdg' too, as the opinion of a previous editor. The example I\u2019m looking at is lines 15-16 of Propertius 1.15 (the 2007 OCT edition). Here\u2019s the note in the apparatus:\n\n15-16 secl. Pescani; post 20 Markland, post 22 Lachmann\n\nMeaning \"Pescani thought these lines don\u2019t belong here and couldn\u2019t locate them; Markland put them after line 20, Lachmann after line 22\". Heyworth, the editor of the text, places the lines at the end of the poem, and brackets them to show that he doesn\u2019t think they are Propertian, so the lemma would probably contain a 'surplus', but Pescani\u2019s 'rdg' would have 'secl'.\n\nThe point is not that 'secl' would take its contents out of the text flow\u2014the editor has to put it somewhere\u2014but that it is marked as not belonging where it\u2019s put.\n\nI was being lazy in comparing it to 'supplied', but I do think they\u2019d occur in similar contexts and have similar kinds of content.\n\n\n> On Oct 18, 2014, at 3:09 , James Cummings <jcummings@users.sf.net> wrote:\n> \n> Hi Hugh. I've thought about this for a few minutes and keep coming back to one initial problem: namely why isn't this just an 'add' element? The only thing that distinguishes it is that you don't know where to put it. But you have to put the 'secl' element somewhere in any case. Usually one puts an 'add' element where you think it is anchored, and then with @place record where it was physically on the page. With 'secl' you'll still need to place it somewhere in the XML hierarchy and I'm concerned that if you don't know where this goes that you'll have to put it somewhere and still record where it was on the physical page. So if we have a nice long 'p' element instead of putting an 'add' part way through to indicate it refers to this location, we might put it at the end and record through an attribute that it is not specifically anchored. We'd still record where on the page it appeared. It seems to me this is a structurally-unanchored 'add' element but not necessarily a semantically different category. It is the modern editor having a problem placing it, and this should be recorded, but to me doesn't really change the nature of the original addition. There is also the question, if this is structurally-unanchored, that it might need to be able to appear in places that 'add' cannot. It might need to be between paragraphs, for example, rather than just at phrase level.

The <add> element and the <surplus> element pretty much cover most of this territory. There's a subcategory of interpolated text that covers text the editor believes was written by the author, but which doesn't belong where it's currently located. If the editor can locate the original place, then a combination of <surplus> and <supplied> or something similar can be used to relocate the text.

  "description": "As per discussion on TEI-L ('space in manuscripts' - 7 Nov 2014), I would like to suggest <space> to be added to att.typed. I believe that <space>'s currently allowed attributes are too limiting, focussing only on the document [size (@quantity & @unit), rendition (@rend)], and not on the text.\r\n\r\n<space>s come in all different shapes and sizes: sometimes it\u2019s just a blank space, at other times some part of the <space> is filled with a symbol, character, etc. which you could mark up using the @rend attribute. (e.g.: <space @rend=\"symbol\">?</space>). But that does not allow you to group gaps together from a textual point of view. A plausible genetic query would be: 'give me all the places in the manuscript(s) where the author was still undecided about his protagonist\u2019s name'. Some of those places will be rendered as symbols (?), some as blanks ( ), some as initials (M), some as a combination (M-), making @rend useless for this query. Adding <space> to att.typed could solve this problem, allowing for the classification of different types of <spaces>.  \r\n\r\nIn addition to adding <space> to att.typed, James Cummings also suggested to change the element description, which currently says: \"indicates the location of a \r\nsignificant space in the copy text\". I agree with James that the word 'copy' should be left out of the description, because it is not necessary and potentially confusing.",

  "summary": "Using `<zone>` for points and paths rather than shapes",
  "description": "I'm working on the encoding of a historical map, and finding that I really need to be able to define paths on the map surface, not just closed shapes. `<zone>` is really constrained so that you cannot use it for paths; the @points attribute must have more than two points, so a straight line from one point to another cannot be captured with it, and the older @ulx, @uly and friends are intended to define a bounding rectangle.\r\n\r\nI think the ability to encode both points and paths is a perfectly simple and reasonable requirement, so I'd like to propose several possible approaches:\r\n\r\n1. The `<zone>` element could be designated the appropriate way to do this, and the current constraint on @points removed so that it can contain one or two points only. The definition of @points would have to be updated, removing an existing current ambiguity: at the moment, we don't say whether the initial coordinate needs to be repeated to close the shape. The new definition would say that if the initial coordinate is repeated at the end, the result is a closed shape, while if it is not, the result is a path.\r\n\r\n+ The `<zone>` element could be provided with two additional attributes, one of which is @point (taking a single coordinate) and the other is @path (taking a sequence of two or more coordinates, which are understood not to be closed to form a shape).\r\n\r\n+ One or two new elements might be created alongside `<zone>`: `<point>` and `<path>`. The latter could inherit @points, but with a different constraint, so that two coordinates would be allowed, and the former would need a different attribute (perhaps @coords).\r\n\r\nI prefer the first solution myself, because it's simpler; the only real objection I see is that it stretches what some people might see as the actual meaning of the word \"zone\",",

If the map _does_ simply represent Cheapside as a zero-width (ifyswim) line, than you're trying trying to encode graphic features rather than text.

Should the TEI accommodate my needs, or push me away in the direction of tag-abuse (which is what I'm doing now), or adopting another standard (which would be SVG in this case, and mighty inconvenient)? This map is (as we hope to argue in Sidney next year) a text in multiple witnesses and versions, and we are trying to encode its textual history to some degree using the mechanisms TEI provides for this purpose.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, of course, there is the obvious worry that as soon as you let me have paths and points, I'll be demanding curves and gradient fills and god knows what else and the TEI will go to hell in a handbasket. `<zone>`s originally had only rectangles, but that was obviously inadequate, so @points was invented; perhaps this was the beginning of a slippery slope.

I started out by using SVG, and having to convert between SVG's path/@d attribute to OpenLayers geoms, but TEI `<zone>`s work for the shapes in a much more straightforward way, and it would be nice to be able to use a single pure-TEI representation for everything.\r\n\r\nI raised the ticket because it seems to me a straightforward and not unreasonable requirement; and because in any case we already have an ambiguity in the definition of @points, in that we don't say whether the final point has to be the same as the first in order to close the shape. If you choose to believe that not explicitly closing the shape gives you a path, then we already have (poor, underspecified and underdescribed) support for paths with more than two points.

  "description": "The TEI dictionary chapter comprises four element for referring back to forms in dictionary entries (oRef, oVar, pRef, pVar), whose respective usage has never corresponded to clear-cut scenarios, especially because of the lack of clear set of use cases and examples. This has lead to a low usage of these elements in most TEI based dictionary projects but also in the absence of best practices for all the concrete cases (examples, etymology) where marking forms and associating them to (real or virtual) entries would help formalising lexical content in a systematic way. \r\n\r\nThe main issue is that the difference between pRef and pVar (resp. oRef/oVar) does not match the logic of tagging form references in a dictionary entry: \r\n\r\n* pRef (resp. oRef) is limited (empty content) to the case where the form is exactly the one on the same entry, which is rarely the case (e.g. when orthographic variants exist)\r\n* pVar is only intended to be used when there is a variation (e.g. inflected form) but contrary to pRef, but with its non empty content, it is often tempting to use it to mark all types of forms\r\n\r\nIt has also been pointed out that there are also issues related to the unsatisfactory  definition of @type and the absence of @notation.\r\n\r\nProposal: we suggest to drop oVar and pVar and extent both the scope and content model of pRef and oRef to offer a simple system for the annotation of forms (orthographic and phonetic) in dictionary entries, with a clear parallel to orth and pron in the description of forms.\r\n\r\nThe main changes would be:\r\n\r\n* allow text in oRef and pRef; while keeping the possibility to leave them empty when necessary\r\n* make them member of att.typed\r\n* make them member of att.lexicographic to bring them in line with and enable full correspondence with linguistic/lexicographic usage of orth> and prone\r\n* add @notation in pRef in order to bring it in line with pron (probably a good opportunity to make a class out of @notation); useful in cases where there are more than one notations being represented in pron\r\n* from a semantic point of view, allow these elements to point to any dictionary entry not just the current entry\u2019s head item (same dictionary or even other dictionaries in the case of the marking up of etymology)\r\n",

  "summary": "<defaultVal> should be removed from all specs",
  "description": "The &lt;defaultVal> element was provided for backwards compatibility in P5 ODD as a way of representing the default value for an attribute, i.e. that which should be assumed if the attribute is not specified. This was useful in the SGML world where tag minimization was an issue, but seems much less appropriate in XML, where its effect is to require a parser to assume the default value was supplied even if the attribute is unspecified. This is annoying if the user attempts to constrain the value by supplying a closed &lt;valList> : if they forget to remove the &lt;defaultVal at the same time, and the default value is not on the closed value list, then it becomes impossible to create a valid instance. It is also a nuisance for software like oddByExample which derives an ODD from document instances because occurrences of an attribute with a default value are indistinguishable from attributes for which a value is actually specified in the source document. \r\n\r\nIn most cases, I think the intention of the element would be better subsumed into the attribute definition (\"if this attribute is not specified then ...\") rather than being magically created by the parser. We hate magic.  \r\n\r\nHowever there are quite a lot of uses of this in P5 (72 to be exact, some of them in attribute classes), so removing them is not a trivial change.\r\n",

Note that default values for attributes only make sense if the attributes themselves are optional, and so it is an error to specify both a default value and anything other than a value of optional for use. \"\r\n\r\nSo my first point is wrong, in the sense that the behaviour I abhor is the one which is written into both DTD and XSD: schemas not only provide constraint and documentation of an instance document, but also complete it by adding attributes and elements which are not present in it. My second point is as Piotr says a more general one about data modelling, but that's what ODD is about, isn't it? We're not trying to provide a precursor only to known schema systems; we're trying to provide an independent modelling system which can be converted (to some extent lossily) into existing schema systems, but which is certainly allowed to support approaches to data modelling which are distinct from them.\r\n\r\n@Sebastian: I'm not sure I understand your question about @usage.",

We accordingly compared the health status among monozygotic and dizygotic women twin pairs who lived together through childhood (until at least age 14) and subsequently were discordant or concordant on adult socioeconomic position.

The study population was composed of 308 women twin pairs (58&#x00025; monozygotic, 42&#x00025; dizygotic); data were obtained on childhood and adult socioeconomic position and on blood pressure, cholesterol, post-load glucose, body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio, physical activity, and self-rated health. Health outcomes among adult women twin pairs who lived together through childhood varied by their subsequent adult occupational class. Cardiovascular factors overall differed more among monozygotic twin pairs that were discordant compared to concordant on occupational class. Moreover, among the monozygotic twins discordant on adult occupational class, the working class twin fared worse and, compared to her professional twin, on average had significantly higher systolic blood pressure (mean matched difference = 4.54 mm Hg; 95&#x00025; confidence interval &#x0005b;CI&#x0005d;, 0.10&#x02013;8.97), diastolic blood pressure (mean matched difference = 3.80 mm Hg; 95&#x00025; CI, 0.44&#x02013;7.17), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (mean matched difference = 7.82 mg/dl; 95&#x00025; CI, 1.07&#x02013;14.57).

If you look at the already-online BHO version of [the 1908 version of] the 1603 text:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.british-history.ac.uk/no-series/survey-of-london-stow/1603\r\n\r\nyou'll see that the text is divided into several distinct sections with different purposes, including a series of individual chapters about the wards of the city, chapters on the municipal government system, sections on hospitals, parish churches, and various other curiousities. It's difficult to imagine constructing a worthwhile abstract for this text without dividing the abstract into headed sections; and only some sort of kludge would enable the use of headings interspersed inside a series of paragraphs.\r\n\r\nThe important thing here is that front matter is from the original text; you shouldn't really put modern editorial content into the `<front>` alongside Stow's own front matter, which includes a dedicatory epistle. This, oddly enough, is what the BHO edition does: it has modern introductory material in its front matter, which then transitions (inside the same roman-numbered page sequence) into Stow's dedication. But this is because they're actually doing an edition of the Kingsford 1908 edition, and that's what Kingsford did, if I understand correctly.\r\n\r\nBut I take the point that we haven't written this abstract yet. It may turn itself into a critical introduction, which would itself be a born-digital text external to the Stow. \r\n\r\nI also see the point about Laurent's cases, but I maintain there is a difference between an editor-supplied abstract (of which the author may know nothing at all) and an authorial abstract (such as an author would supply for an article they submit to a journal). The former belongs in the header; the latter in `<front>`.\r\n\r\nI worry about Piotr's point #2: this amounts to saying \"if we provide this feature, people may abuse it for something it wasn't intended for.\" That's always true of every feature.",

  "summary": "Provide place to record the Unicode Normalization Form used",
  "description": "TEI is about text. Sometimes we read text, sometimes we want to find text. Finding text \u2013 ordinary text \u2013 can present problems because of the way Unicode allows two ways to encode accented characters. \"A\u030astro\u0308m\" and \"\u00c5str\u00f6m\" may look the same, but you may not be able to find one with the other, since the two accented characters may either occur as one character (the precomposed characters \"\u00c5\" and \"\u00f6\",) or as two (a base character, \"A\" and \"o\", followed by a combining character, \"\u030a\" and \"\u0308\"). Similar problems occur with ligatures such as \"wo\ufb00le\" contra \"woffle\". These pairs are canonically equivalent and a Unicode-conformant application ought to treat these as identical, but it appears that in point of fact only a few Mac OS X applications do so. It is possible to normalize these documents, making them follow one or the other of the approaches throughout, using different Unicode Normalization Forms, NFC (\"C\" for \"composed\") and NFD (\"D\" for \"decomposed\"). The command-line tool uconv can make these transformations, but very few desktop applications can. Standards-conformant XSLT and XQuery processors will have the ability to normalize encoding, since fn:normalize-unicode() is an XPath function, and indexers such as Lucene can hook into libraries like ICU4J, but there is no guarantee that this is done, or that both the text basis and any input terms are normalized according to the same scheme. \r\n\r\nIt is therefore with good reason that the Guidelines, vi. Languages and Character Sets, have the following \u2013 quite strong \u2013 recommendation:\r\n\r\n\"It is important that every Unicode-based project should agree on, consistently implement and fully document a comprehensive and coherent normalization practice. As well as ensuring data integrity within a given project, a consistently implemented and properly documented normalization policy is essential for successful document interchange.\"\r\n\r\nThe problem is, where to document such a crucial piece of information? I believe this calls for an obligatory element in encodingDesc (perhaps \"NFDecl\"?) to register which normalization practice has been followed.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, TEI could stipulate that all TEI documents are to be normalized according to NFC. This is the recommended Internet practice, since in the early days of the introduction of Unicode this provided a way to make accented characters backwards compatible \u2013 the precomposed characters were introduced in order to secure round-trip-ability with legacy encodings.\r\n\r\nFor some purposes (such as, \"find all \"a\" characters with whichever accents they may have\"), NFD is easier to work with, and NFD is more general, applying one one rule for accents, whereas in NFC some accented characters have precomposed forms and others not. This could argue for stipulating the use of NFD instead.\r\n\r\nAccording to Unicode any application is allowed to convert to and from these two normalization forms, just as it can switch between UTF-8 (commonly used for exchange) and UTF-16 (commonly used internally), so no assumption should be made as to which form is used, only that it is used consistently. Indeed, when posting this request, I find that the Chrome browser normalizes \"A\u030astro\u0308m\" and \"\u00c5str\u00f6m\" \u2013 which is alright, but would be rather confusing here \u2013 but that Firefox does not.\r\n\r\nA special problem arises as long as not all applications treat the two pairs of characters as equivalent: this makes it necessary that it should be possible, with a text editor, to search both normalized and un-normalized text and to convert freely between the two normalization forms. oXygen has announced that it will try to make searching along these lines possible (and presumably it could open up for conversion as well), but there is a severe lack of tools in this area.\r\n\r\nThe Guidelines passage makes a clear and sound recommendation, and the information is requires is simple (unicode-normalized: yes/no; unicode normalization form: NFC/NFD), and there should be a definite place to record this information. What argues against this feature request is that this is yet another technical matter foisted upon the working TEI user and that the tools for making conversions of the required sort are few.\r\n\r\nSee http://markmail.org/thread/xov2nkg5iwas4uv3.",

The guidelines and usage practices for EpiDoc are to use <hi> for the purposes we are describing (subscript, superscript, color, etc.).   For reference:\r\nhttp://www.stoa.org/epidoc/gl/latest/trans-charactershighlighted.html\r\nhttp://www.stoa.org/epidoc/gl/latest/trans-raisedlowered.html\r\nhttp://www.stoa.org/epidoc/gl/latest/trans-tallorsmall.html\r\n\r\nTo be as interoperable as possible with an existing usage, we are requesting the ability to use <hi> within <m> in the same way that the guidelines dictate <hi> usage within <w>.  Our other choices are to follow your suggestion and use <seg> throughout our entire corpus, and then it will not be compatible with the papyri.info corpus; or to use <hi> whenever we don't have an <m> annotation and <seg> whenever we do, but that seems a little strange and internally inconsistent.  And again, is not interoperable with papyri.info.  \r\n\r\nIf the TEI agrees to the change, we will then petition EpiDoc for this change, as well. We are taking this approach, because we think allowing <hi> to be nested inside <m> is a less significant change than asking EpiDoc to change their <seg> and <hi> usages and Guidelines.\r\n\r\nThanks for the consideration.",

  "description": "It seems time to rethink the definitions of the teiHeader element in\r\nline with expanded applications of it as a generic metadata\r\ncontainer. At the same time, it would be useful to simplify the\r\ncontent model of the &lt;TEI> element itself.\r\n\r\nThis ticket proposes the following changes:\r\n\r\n1. Change the description of &lt;teiHeader> from \"supplies the\r\ndescriptive and declarative information making up an electronic title\r\npage for every TEI-conformant document.\"  to \"supplies descriptive and\r\ndeclarative metadata associated with a digital resource or set of\r\nresources\". This change makes it easier to use the teiHeader to\r\ndocument an &lt;fsdDecl> (as is currently proposed) and also to use it\r\nwith the proposed new &lt;standOff> element.\r\n\r\n2. Change the description for the class model.resourceLike from\r\n\"groups non-textual elements which may appear together with a header\r\nand a text to constitute a TEI document\" to \"groups separate elements\r\nwhich constitute the content of a digital resource, as opposed to its\r\nmetadata.\"\r\n\r\n3. Change the content model of &lt;TEI> from \r\n~~~~~\r\n  <content>\r\n    <group xmlns=\"http://relaxng.org/ns/structure/1.0\">\r\n      <ref name=\"teiHeader\"/>\r\n      <choice>\r\n        <group>\r\n          <oneOrMore>\r\n            <ref name=\"model.resourceLike\"/>\r\n          </oneOrMore>\r\n          <optional>\r\n            <ref name=\"text\"/>\r\n          </optional>\r\n        </group>\r\n        <ref name=\"text\"/>\r\n      </choice>\r\n    </group>\r\n  </content>\r\n~~~~~~\r\nto\r\n~~~~~\r\n  <content>\r\n    <group xmlns=\"http://relaxng.org/ns/structure/1.0\">\r\n      <ref name=\"teiHeader\"/>\r\n      <choice>\r\n          <oneOrMore>\r\n            <ref name=\"model.resourceLike\"/>\r\n          </oneOrMore>\r\n      </choice>\r\n    </group>\r\n  </content>\r\n~~~~~\r\n\r\nand (of course) add <text> to model.resourceLike\r\n\r\nThe only possible downside of this change is that if you have an ODD\r\nin which model.resourceLike is deleted for some reason, you will now\r\nthereby delete the &lt;text> element. But deleting model classes is an\r\nintrinsically dangerous procedure which should only be undertaken by\r\nthe fully aware.",
